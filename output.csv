Special Correspondent,"Former Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh on Saturday said the Environment Impact Assessment Act (EIA) 2020 as a subordinate legislation violates the parent Environment Protection Act, adding that the Modi government has proposed the changes keeping in mind the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ criteria. In a virtual interaction organised by the Research Department of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) and moderated by former MP Rajeev Gowda, Mr. Ramesh said the proposed changes would not only dilute the environment laws but would take away the powers of the State government. “I think the legal reason against EIA is very strong and I would encourage people to take to legal recourse,” Mr. Ramesh said. Mr. Ramesh, who heads the Parliamentary Committee on Environment, Science and Technology, claimed that that the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) ultimately wanted to move towards a system where EIA clearances would be given online. He also alleged that the MoEF had blocked its sites to prevent public comments on the EIA 2020 from coming in. “When I was the Minister, once I got 800 mails. I knew that Greenpeace was behind it. I gave them a call, told them that one mail was enough. I laughed, they laughed but I didn’t block the site. The disturbing part is that this government wants protests to go as a democratic tradition,” he said.",2020-08-09,TH32307344,NEW DELHI,People should tackle EIA legally: Jairam Ramesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/people-should-tackle-eia-legally-jairam-ramesh/article32307344.ece
Legal Correspondent,"The Mumbai police on Saturday told the Supreme Court that the CBI had proceeded with “indecent haste” to register a case into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. The CBI should have waited for a final decision from the Supreme Court on a plea by actor Rhea Chakaraborty to transfer a case of abetment to suicide registered against her from Patna to Mumbai. The Mumbai police, in their reply, said the Supreme Court had on August 5 continued to hear the case despite being informed that the CBI had accepted the Bihar government’s request to take over the probe. Bihar has neither judicial nor investigative jurisdiction. Neither the cause nor consequence of the death has happened in Patna. The Bihar police should have, in their own volition, transferred the case to the Mumbai police. The alleged crime of theft has occurred in Mumbai. The Mumbai police said the Bihar police should transfer the FIR to them. Countering allegations by Bihar that an IPS officer, Vinay Tiwary, in its police team was ‘forcibly’ quarantined, the reply said domestic passengers entering Maharashtra have to follow the COVID-19 preventive norms. It said Mr. Tiwary has already reached back home in Bihar. In a 58-page affidavit, Bihar said though Rajput died in Mumbai, his father suffered the consequence of the passing away of his “young and vibrant son” in Patna. It said an offence can be tried either at the place where it has been committed or where the consequence ensues. The Nitish Kumar government said it had recommended the case for transfer to the CBI after preliminary investigation showed that evidence was in Mumbai and also spread across the country. The sensitivity of the case, the inter-State ramifications and the presence of the accused persons in Mumbai had compelled the Bihar police chief to request a probe by a Central agency like the CBI.",2020-08-09,TH32307342,NEW DELHI,"CBI registered case with “indecent haste”, Mumbai police tell SC",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cbi-registered-case-with-indecent-haste-mumbai-police-tell-sc/article32307342.ece
Staff Reporter,"With the number of COVID infections “hitting the peak” of the pandemic curve, the State has adopted a proactive strategy of treating all persons with certain COVID symptoms irrespective of the test result to avoid deaths based on clinical diagnosis. Special Chief Secretary (Health, Medical and Family Welfare) K.S. Jawahar Reddy told a press conference on Saturday that Andhra Pradesh had entered the peak of the pandemic curve, and several districts were already at peak of infections while others are about to hit it. “Most districts such as East Godavari, West Godavari, Kurnool, Anantapur and Guntur have already entered the peak stage and others are about to witness the peak of infections. As we enter the sixth month of the pandemic, it is a natural consequence to see the peak,” Dr. Reddy said. “Having less than 1% mortality rate, the pandemic has been well managed clinically in the State. The focus is now on reducing the mortality rate further by identifying severely ill persons even without testing them for COVID,” Dr. Reddy said. “Persons with continuous fever for three to four days, breathlessness, and oxygen saturation level below 94% will be considered as severe symptomatic cases. Even without testing, they will be immediately admitted to hospitals and treated. To identify them, we have given pulse oxymeters to ANMs and with the help of ward and village volunteers and ASHA workers patients would be identified at the ground level,” Dr. Reddy added. “We have three parameters in place to avoid deaths. One is having a minimum of six to seven day treatment window. Second, following all treatment protocols and medication available. The third is to not allow any critical patient to die without being treated with ventilator support,” he said. “In most cases, deaths are occurring within three days of admission. Sometimes it is on the same day of admission. This is because of late reporting and identification of the persons infected. I appeal to the public to come forward and dial 104 or local volunteers and ANMs if they are experiencing severe symptoms. Such persons will be immediately admitted to a hospital and treated,” Dr. Reddy said. About the age group of persons who succumbed to COVID, he said that about 70% are of 40 to 60 years of age group with and without comorbidities and remaining were cases of patients aged less than 40 years. He said there were over 4,000 containment clusters in the State at present and nearly 60% of them were in urban areas. Seeking cooperation of the public, Dr. Reddy said that every person was prone to COVID infection and the only things that could save us is “COVID appropriate behaviour” and “non-pharmaceutical public health measures”. He said the State had already begun sero-surveillance survey in Krishna, East Godavari, Anantapur and Nellore districts through CLIA tests, where 3,750 people in each district would be tested for antibodies. The results of the survey wouldbe known in a week, he added.",2020-08-09,TH32307070,VIJAYAWADA,Andhra Pradesh has entered peak of pandemic curve: Jawahar Reddy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/andhra-pradesh-has-entered-peak-of-pandemic-curve-jawahar-reddy/article32307070.ece

He should have thought about the feelings of all sections of the population before attending the event,” Mr. Chowdhury said, adding that the “PM has made a mistake”. The Minister, who heads the State unit Jamiat-e-Ulama Hind, said Muslims have not got justice in this matter. “I am happy to be part of Mamata Banerjee’s government but it would be wrong for me not to speak out now,” Mr. Chowdhury said. The Minister for Mass Education and Library Services in a video statement also urged people to remain patient and not to hit the streets. “We do not disrespect Ram. Islam teaches us to respect all religions.” Mr. Chowdhury said the BJP and the RSS must be thinking why Muslims have not hit the streets in protest. “Indian Muslims believe in the rule of law, the Constitution, democracy and national unity… It does not matter if a temple is built and the PM goes and lays its first stone. No matter what, the whole world knows it is a mosque.” On building a mosque at a different place in Ayodhya, Mr. Chowdhury said a mosque as per the Islamic law can only be built at a place which is bought or donated by the believers of the religion. The Minister confirmed to that he had made these remarks and said he has released the message on behalf of the Jamiat-E-Ulama Hind and not on behalf of the party. The remarks by the TMC leader, who has significant influence over the Muslim community in the State, assume significance as the party has maintained a silence on the issue.

Hemani Bhandari,"There is an unwritten code of conduct among the sex workers at the Swami Shradhanand Marg, the city’s age-old red light area, where business has slowly resumed. Only regular clients are entertained; they need to wash their body with sanitisers and they should wear masks and gloves. Sitting on a narrow stairway are Guddi and Kajal. Their lipstick and kohl are markedly visible, as is a mask around their neck. They are ready, but the business is grim. “For the last few weeks, we have been getting ready but there is hardly any guest. One in a day or two; that too, not a regular occurrence,” complained Guddi, as Kajal went to the window facing the main road. “ [We’ve started standing at the window only a few days ago]”, she chimes in. At this moment, a lean youth wearing mask and spotting jeans, a blue check shirt and sport shoes climbs up. The women check him thoroughly. He is then splashed with sanitiser from shoulder to toe and then taken inside. “This is the only way to at least feel safe. They are sanitised completely. Also, we mostly don’t entertain new guests,” said Guddi. In another brothel, the women revealed that several of their colleagues have left for their hometowns. Rupa, who arrived here from Bengaluru 15 years ago, held her one-and-a-half-year-old son Rohit as she sat on the stairs. She was unkempt and without make-up. “No one has been coming, so what is the point in getting ready? There are hardly any girls left also. Men only come when there are more girls. Let’s see when the situation gets better,” she said. So has been the case at a ‘posh’ brothel, which offers ‘mujra’ every night. The cook and caretaker, who identified himself as Inderjeet, said that many women have left for their villages. And those living in Delhi return to their residence every morning and return late evening. “Ours is a very selective clientele. These days, they call and inform in advance if they are coming. Those we don’t recognise are not allowed to come upstairs,” he said, standing in a huge room on the second floor of the building. The “selected and old clients” also take care of the needs of the brothels, he added. “Everything touched by the client is sanitised, including the doorknobs and edges, chairs and sofas. In fact, there are some clients who have been associated with us for years and take care of our essential needs,” he said. Talking about essential needs, all the women spoke to said that they’ve had no hassles in managing the food. Every 15 days, they are provided with ration, which they can collect from government schools. “Everything, including sugar and tea leaves, is provided. None-essential expenditure is taken care by some means or the other,” said Kajal. Inderjeet, however, said that while business has come down significantly, the area lights up after sunset and “hasn’t lost its glory”.",2020-08-09,TH32307761,NEW DELHI,Embracing unwritten protocols to ensure safety,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/embracing-unwritten-protocols-to-ensure-safety/article32307761.ece

When he reached near Aam Aadmi Party office, a person wearing a police uniform, sitting in an auto, stopped him. “The accused threatened him of challan for rash and negligent driving and asked Rs. 8,000 as fine,” Mr. Bhatia said, adding that Kumar did not have cash, following which the accused forced him to sit in the auto and asked to withdraw money from an ATM. He also threatened that if the fine was not paid, he would be implicated in a case. The police said that the two went to Connaught Place and the accused sent Kumar to an ATM to withdraw money. “Finding an opportunity, the victim fled and reached DDU Marg where his bike was parked. However, his phone was taken by the accused,” the officer said. After a case was registered and investigation was taken up, the police analysed the CCTV cameras, identified and arrested Chander. During interrogation, the police said, it was revealed that Chander used to work in Delhi Transport Department and was dismissed in 2005 on corruption charges. After being dismissed, he did not have work and started extorting or cheating people either in the name of Delhi Transport or police He has committed several such incidents in the area.

SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT,"The Punjab government has decided to withdraw the police security for Congress MP Partap Singh Bajwa after an assessment showed that he had virtually no threat perception. An official spokesperson on Saturday said the security provided to the Rajya Sabha MP had become redundant since he had procured personal security directly from the Union Home Ministry. Notably, Mr. Bajwa has been at loggerheads with Chief Minister Amarinder Singh ever since the Congress came to power in 2017. Recently, he and Rajya Sabha MP Shamsher Singh Dullo had approached the Governor seeking a CBI and Enforcement Directorate probe into the production of illegal liquor amid the hooch tragedy. Following this, State Congress chief Sunil Jakhar and all the Cabinet Ministers demanded strict action against both the MPs for their alleged “anti-party and anti-government” activities. On the security issue, the spokesperson added that Mr. Bajwa had been getting enhanced security from the Punjab police, way beyond what he was entitled to as Rajya Sabha MP. This was because the government had decided not to withdraw it as he was the party’s State chief.

The number of new cases has been less than 1,500 for the past 23 consecutive days, which is less compared to June. On June 23, daily new cases touched almost 4,000 — highest so far — and since then it has been dropping.

Satyasundar Barik,"Encouraged by germination and subsequent growth in bamboo plantations, Odisha’s Athagarh Forest Division has begun casting seed-balls inside different forests to enrich food stock for elephants. The growth in bamboo plantation is expected to meet food requirement of elephants, which often stray out of the forests and raid human habitations in search of food. Villagers who bear the brunt of the elephant attacks have come forward to prepare bamboo seed balls and scatter them in 38 reserve forests under the Athagarh Forest Division. A vigorous monsoon with copious rains has helped the villagers and forest department personnel ensure that the seed-balls have germinated. “Bamboo shoots are relished by elephants. We are highly optimistic that it will meet the food requirement of wild elephants in their own habitats. “They will not stray out of the forest in search of food,” said Sasmita Lenka, Athagarh Divisional Forest Officer. For restoration of bamboo forests, a massive awareness campaign was launched in all the villages hit by elephant depredation. One quintal of bamboo seeds were brought from Jashipur in Mayurbhanj district. Making seed balls and scattering them in the forest is quite a time consuming task. However, the villagers joined the campaign hoping to ensure the bamboo plants will keep the elephants in the forests rather than straying into their villages. “Elephants love chewing bamboo shoots. Once the shoots come out of the plants, the animal depredation in villages will definitely come down,” said Ms. Lenka. Athagarh Forest Division is one of the worst-hit areas as far as man-elephant conflict is concerned. “Elephants frequently raid villages coming under Athagarh and Khuntuni range and damage standing paddy crops. “Even fruit-bearing trees and vegetable plants are not spared. The situation becomes extremely volatile when any human gets killed by a marauding elephant,” the DFO said. Last year, the division had thrown seed balls using 950 kg of bamboo seeds inside the forest. “The survival rate ranged between 50 and 60%. The man-elephant conflict is complex. No one has simple solution. We are looking at a long-term solution. We will keep on creating bamboo plantation inside forests,” said Ms. Lenka.",2020-08-09,TH32307637,BHUBANESWAR,Odisha turns to seed-bombs to fight a jumbo problem,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-life/odisha-turns-to-seed-bombs-to-fight-a-jumbo-problem/article32307637.ece

Iitially called the Grand Final, the event brings together USA’s Hikaru Nakamura and Russia’s Daniil Dubov in the other semifinal. Carlsen, winner of three events and Dubov one, qualified for the finale. Nakamura and Dubov, the two non-winners, made it on the basis of their points on the Tour. Answering questions, Liren said, “I am not tired because of the games or playing too many tournaments (since April). “It is mainly because of the timing. For me, in China, the games begin at 10 p.m. If each of the four rapid rounds goes for an hour, then for me it is 2 a.m. Thereafter, it is not easy to sleep immediately,” said the genial Chinese No. 1. About his chances against Carlsen, Liren said, “I think they are low. I did beat him in the last Sinquefield Cup playoff but that has not happened often. “If it happens often, then he won’t be Magnus Carlsen.” The Norwegian, too, showed a lot of respect for the Chinese when asked to look at the much-awaited clash. “It’s going to be unbelievably tough. “He ’s shown such class on the Tour that it’s plain to see that he’s a very strong opponent,” said the World champion. The semifinals will be best of five sets, with each set comprising four rapid games. “In case the players are tied 2-2, two blitz games will be played and thereafter, if 3-3, an Armageddon game to break the tie.

Reuters,"Manchester City reached the Champions League quarterfinals after beating Real Madrid 2-1 (4-2 on aggregate) at home on Friday, with Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Jesus taking advantage of dreadful defensive errors. City will next face Lyon which knocked out Juventus despite Cristiano Ronaldo’s brace. The Italian side’s elimination saw manager Maurizio Sarri being sacked after one season in charge. Real, trailing 2-1 from the first-leg, made a disastrous start, gifting Sterling a ninth minute opener because of Varane’s mistake. City ’keeper Ederson, could do nothing when Karim Benzema rose to nod home a superb pin-point cross from Rodrygo. Later, Varane’s attempted header back to ’keeper Courtois was too weak and an alert Jesus flicked it in. At Turin, a 2-1 win was not enough for the Serie A champion as the French side reached the quarterfinals on away goals. Lyon went ahead early from a penalty before Ronaldo levelled from another spot kick. The Portuguese superstar put the home team ahead as he found space for a shot and blasted a goal from 25 metres, but it was not enough.

But he also said his economic team “continues to work in good faith to reach an agreement with Democrats in Congress” on a relief package including unemployment benefits and protections against evictions.

Meera Srinivasan,"For almost all Opposition parties in Sri Lanka, Wednesday’s general election spelt huge losses in the face of the landslide victory secured by the ruling party of the Rajapaksas. But one group stood out. The Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA), which represents Malayaha Tamils in the island’s Central, Uva, Sabaragamuwa and Western Provinces, retained all six seats in Parliament. While the number is small compared to the coveted two-thirds majority that the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) secured in the 225-member House, it is not insignificant. How did the TPA’s MPs make it, despite being part of Sajith Premadasa’s weak Opposition alliance and despite a contest with powerful rivals in the Ceylon Workers’ Congress (CWC) aligned to the ruling SLPP? Only two of the CWC’s candidates won, including Jeevan Thondaman, son of former Minister and popular politician Arumugan Thondaman, who suddenly passed away in May. “Trust is the word. That is the reason. The TPA’s achievements in the last four years have outnumbered all past performances of other parties,” said Alliance leader and former Minister Mano Ganesan, who won from Colombo district. Mr. Ganesan’s colleague V. Radhakrishnan from Nuwara Eliya agreed. “People have recognised our work. If they were not happy, we wouldn’t be back,” he said. The TPA could not do much to ensure tea estate workers got the minimum wage despite their incessant protests spanning three years, but its MPs appear to have scored in other areas concerning the million-strong community. Development, for instance. The Alliance shifted the politics of Malayaha Tamils — including some 1.5 lakh people employed in the tea estates — from one of “patronage to [one of] rights”, according to Palani Thigambaram, a former Minister widely credited with building houses in the estates. “We worked to address our people’s right to land and housing, we helped them get original deeds for the first time. We created a dedicated authority for Hill Country development and the people have appreciated that,” he said, adding: “some people think voters are fools. But the fact is voters know what they are doing. It is important to pay attention.” But for this trust built over four years, it may not have been easy for the candidates to win, especially from Mr. Premadasa’s Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), which has been on a weak footing since last November’s presidential poll. Nine months after Mr. Premadasa lost to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the SJB secured just 54 seats, about 24% of the votes, in Wednesday’s general election. Its parent party, the United National Party has been reduced to a single seat. It is both consistent work on the ground and efforts to bring about structural changes that the people have acknowledged, according to B. Gowthaman, a lawyer and civil society activist. “The TPA’s work especially with land rights and bringing local government authorities to work inside the estates, appealed not only to the workers, but also to the intelligentsia within the community, like teachers and other professionals,” he said. While much of TPA’s accomplishments are linked to the Ministries its MPs held, they are not afraid to sit in Opposition now. “We will play a constructive role in Opposition, keeping in mind the interests of the people we represent. We will also work with all Tamil and Muslim parties along with progressive minded Sinhalese, keeping the Sri Lankan identity in mind,” said Mr. Ganesan, a vocal legislator in the last Parliament.

Agence France Presse,"China on Saturday slammed the U.S. for imposing “barbarous” sanctions in response to Beijing’s crackdown in Hong Kong, capping a dramatic week of deteriorating relations between the world’s two biggest economies. In the toughest U.S. action on Hong Kong since China imposed a sweeping new security law on the territory, Washington on Friday imposed sanctions on a group of Chinese and Hong Kong officials — including the city’s leader Carrie Lam. The move came after President Donald Trump’s administration forced Chinese Internet giants TikTok and WeChat to end all operations in the U.S., in a twin diplomatic-commercial offensive set to grow ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November. China on Saturday criticised the sanctions as “barbarous and rude”. “The ill intentions of U.S. politicians to support people who are anti-China and messing up Hong Kong have been clearly revealed,” Beijing’s Liaison Office in Hong Kong said in a statement. The Treasury Department announced it was freezing the U.S. assets of Chief Executive Carrie Lam and 10 other senior officials, including Luo Huining — the head of the Liaison Office. It accused the sanctioned individuals of being “directly responsible for implementing Beijing’s policies of suppression of freedom and democratic processes”. The move criminalises any U.S. financial transactions with the sanctioned officials. In a short statement, Mr. Luo said he welcomed the blacklisting. “I have done what I should do for the country and for Hong Kong,” he said. “I don’t have a dime’s worth in foreign assets.” The Hong Kong government described the sanctions as “shameless and despicable”. “We will fully support the Central government to adopt countermeasures,” it said in a statement. The city’s commerce secretary Edward Yau warned that the “savage and unreasonable” sanctions could have blowback for American businesses in Hong Kong. China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said the sanctions list “rudely tramples on international law” and “will be nailed to the historic pillar of shame forever.” Facebook barred Ms. Lam and the 10 other sanctioned officials from advertising on the platform, with a spokesperson saying on Saturday that it had “a legal obligation to take action.” Beijing’s security law was imposed in late June, following last year’s huge pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, sending a political chill through the semi-autonomous city. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the security law violated promises made by China ahead of Hong Kong’s 1997 handover that the city could keep key freedoms and autonomy for 50 years. “Today’s actions send a clear message that the Hong Kong authorities’ actions are unacceptable,” said Mr. Pompeo in a statement.

Agence France Presse,"China has boosted its efforts to influence the U.S. presidential election in November and wants President Donald Trump to lose because it sees him as “unpredictable,” a top U.S. intelligence official said Friday. “We assess that China prefers that President Trump — whom Beijing sees as unpredictable — does not win re-election,” said William Evanina, Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center. “China has been expanding its influence efforts ahead of November 2020 to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressure political figures it views as opposed to China’s interests, and deflect and counter criticism of China,” Mr. Evanina said in a statement. He pointed to China’s criticism of Mr. Trump’s handling of the COVID-19 epidemic, of the U.S. closure of China’s Houston consulate, and of the U.S. administration’s stances on Chinese actions in Hong Kong and the South China Sea. “Beijing recognises that all of these efforts might affect the presidential race,” said Mr. Evanina. Mr. Trump enthusiastically agreed with the warning, which cast him as a threat to Beijing. “China would love us to have an election where Donald Trump lost to sleepy Joe Biden,” he told journalists. Mr. Evanina said Iran is using social media disinformation to divide the country and hurt Mr. Trump, while Russia is meddling to damage the campaign of his Democratic opponent Joe Biden. “This is consistent with Moscow’s public criticism of him when he was Vice-President for his role in the Obama administration’s policies on Ukraine and its support for the anti-Putin opposition inside Russia,” he said.

Mohammed Iqbal,"The process licensor work for Rajasthan’s Barmer oil refinery has been completed with the targets set for progress of infrastructure works before the project is finished by October 2022. The Rs. 43,129-crore project, which was earlier caught in a political quagmire, has come back to the priority list of the Congress government here. Additional Chief Secretary (Mines & Petroleum) Subodh Agarwal said on Saturday that the project would have nine refinery and four petrochemical units, for which the basic design engineering work had been completed. A survey has been undertaken for laying the pipelines for crude oil, natural gas and water. Mr. Agarwal said the project would become operational in March 2023, though some of its works were adversely affected because of the COVID-19 lockdown. As many as 155 purchase orders for Rs. 20,500 crore worth of construction and other works have been released till July-end. After the UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi laid the project’s foundation stone in 2013, the previous BJP regime stalled it and renegotiated the terms with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited. Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated “commencement of work” at the project site in Pachpadra in 2018 and accused the Congress of announcing the project without any clearances or budget allocation.

Special Correspondent,"The Electric Vehicles Policy 2020, notified by the Delhi government on Friday, seeks to affect a major transformation when it comes to last-mile connectivity in the Capital – whether related to goods and services or for citizens. The policy not only envisions the replacement of the existing autorickshaw fleet with e-autos and State-run buses, progressively, with e-buses, but also ensures that delivery-based services operating in the city are powered by e-mobility. Ride hailing service providers, according to the policy, will be allowed to operate electric two-wheeler taxis subject to operating within the guidelines to be issued by the Transport Department. The incentives provided by the policy, it stated, led the government to expect that it would encourage delivery service providers related to food delivery, e-commerce logistics providers and couriers to switch to using electric two-wheelers. “To ensure the switch happens in a time-bound manner, all delivery service providers shall be expected to convert 50% of their fleet operating in Delhi to electric by March 31, 2023 and 100% by March 31 March, 2025,” the policy states. Delivery service providers who commit to achieve these targets will also be eligible for financing support from the Delhi Finance Corporation. By providing incentives related to the purchase and use of new electric autos instead of the current fleet mainly powered by CNG, an open permit system will be put in place to provide permits on first come, first served basis to those with valid light motor vehicle driving licences and a Public Service Vehicle badge. Unlike the existing cap on the number of CNG-run autorickshaws, which are allowed to ply in the city, the Delhi government, according to the policy, is in favour of not having any cap on permits issued to e-autos in Delhi, since they are zero-emission vehicles and can be very effective in ensuring clean, last-mile connectivity. “Pending further orders on this matter by Hon’ble Supreme Court, the open permit system for e-autos shall be subject to the cap on maximum number of autos in Delhi as fixed by the apex court,” the policy states. A Purchase Incentive of Rs. 30,000 per vehicle will be provided by the government to registered owners of e-autos. Half of the State-run buses to be procured for commuters by the Delhi government over the next three years too, according to the policy, will be “pure electric buses” starting with the induction of 1,000 pure electric buses by 2020.

The Delhi government said that Mr. Kejriwal has assured the residents of speedy disposal of the problem and has given a deadline of 10 days to NDMC officials to ensure cleanliness in the area. The plant has also been given an ultimatum that it will be shut down if the problem is not addressed by August 20.

Wet garbage is brought and compost manure is made from it at the plant before being later used for plants. “Residents from 39 to 69 in Sector-4 in Gol Market are the most affected by the stench.

mARRI RAMU,"The needle of suspicion in sensational land-grabbing cases in Karimnagar district is pointing to employees of not the just Revenue department. In some instances, glaring negligence of some Registration department employees too has come to light. A case in point is that of a retired deputy tahsildar B. Hanamatha Reddy. He purchased nearly 1,200 square yards of land in Vavilalapally in 2018 and got it registered. A few weeks ago, he learnt that land grabbers not only occupied his land but got registered it through two sale deeds using imposters in his place. He approached the Karimnagar police who registered a case. The modus operandi of using an impostor in the place of a property owner (who is described as vendor in registration documents) is not unusual. But the failure of the Karimnagar Sub-Registrar office to notice the ‘cheating crime being committed before them’ raised eyebrows. The conspirators created a fake Aadhaar card in Hanamantha Reddy’s name. But they used imposter’s photo and his original Aadhaar card number. They did this because during registration the authorities check thumb impressions of vendors which are verified through Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) server. During the mandatory process of E-KYC, the Aadhaar details of the vendor get displayed on the sale deed. The same is printed on the registered documents. In Hanamantha Reddy’s case, the accused got two sale deeds registered and used two imposters. Since the impostors used their real Aadhaar card numbers, their original names, Kodari Satyanarayana and Kodi Malleshwar Rao, appeared on the sale deed. On the top of the sale deed, the imposter’s name is mentioned as B. Hanamantha Reddy and beneath that their original names got printed on the same page! “This could not have been done without the connivance of Registration department employees though they might say it is an oversight,” said Lok Satta president N. Srinivas. The quickness of the Registration department in registering a sale deed and another general power of attorney of the same property (a graveyard) on the same day within a gap of an hour also leaves a lot to be desired about their employees,”says Bommakal ward member Thota Kiran Kumar. This land was surrendered by the late former legislator and being used by people as graveyard. The Revenue department issued proceedings on that land this March. Based on the proceedings, the land was registered in the names of the late former legislator’s two family members on June 4. The same day, another document was registered, creating a sale deed-cum-general power of attorney in the names of some private persons. This transaction too has come under the scanner of the police and revenue departments in the inquiries into land grabbing cases in Karimnagar.",2020-08-09,TH32307819,KARIMNAGAR,Suspicion over role of registration staff too,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/suspicion-over-role-of-registration-staff-too/article32307819.ece

Staff Reporter,"A common complaint among COVID-19 patients is the exorbitant charges of private hospitals in Telangana. Till date, 1,039 complaints were lodged against private hospitals through WhatsApp number (9154170960) announced by the Health department. Of the 1,039 complaints, 136 are regarding inappropriate billing and excess charges for COVID treatment, 16 are related to insurance. Others complained about private hospitals not following safety protocols or preventive care measures. Addressing a press conference at State Health campus in Koti on Saturday, Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao said a dedicated team is working on the complaints. “The complaints are sent to District Medical and Health Officer (DMHO) concerned for thorough enquiry. All hospitals were issued show-cause notices. Action will be taken against those who do not follow government guidelines related to treatment charges and protocols,” Dr Rao said. The State government on June 15 issued a government order announcing the maximum rates chargeable by private hospitals for various services provided by them for COVID treatment. The charges range between Rs. 4,000 and Rs. 9,000 per day. Some services were excluded such as charges for high-end medicines. In the past few days, permission given to two private hospitals in Hyderabad to attend COVID-19 cases was revoked by the senior health official. However, he clarified that their intention is not to shut down private hospitals as providing treatment only at government hospitals will be difficult, and that a section of people went to seek medical treatment from private hospitals. “But we should ensure quality treatment is provided at reasonable charges,” Dr Rao said. Though action was taken against private hospitals, some continued to charge Rs. 60,000 to Rs. 70,000 per day, and collected money in advance. Senior health officials said people must opt to get admitted at government hospitals and not to shell out lakhs of money for treatment at private hospitals. They stressed that high-end medicines such as Remdesivir, oxygen lines, are established at government health facilities including at Primary Health Centres. During the press conference, the senior officials said people are under the misconception that costly medicines used in the treatment are provided only at private hospitals. “Around 25,000 vials of Remdesivir are distributed to government hospitals across the State.

Serish Nanisetti,"The discovery of five letters of Brahmi script found on the side of a rock in the Manjeera valley by a bunch of researchers is set to push back the early history of Telangana by more than three centuries. “The earliest inscriptions found in Telangana date back to 1st Century AD in Kotilingala. This inscription is certified as early Brahmi script that was in use during the 2nd Century BC,” says M. A. Srinivasan, a doctoral student of Buddhist history in the region. The inscription was found on a rock on a hillock opposite the Chennakesava Temple in Malthummeda village in Kamareddy district, about six kilometres from the Pocharam Dam reservoir. Epigraphist K. Maniratnam Reddy has deciphered the five-letter word found on the rock as, “Mādavachhaṁda. It is in Prakrit language and Brāhmī characters of the 2nd century B.C. Seems to be the name of a person”. The discovery adds to the understanding of the socio-mercantile ties of the region. “The Kotilingala inscription is in the Godavari Valley, this inscription on the banks of Manjeera River shows the spread of Buddhism in the region,” informs Mr. Srinivasan. He began exploring the area after the discovery of neolithic cave shelter as well as some cave paintings showing a continuum of human activities. “The Satavahanas ruled this areas of Deccan for 450 years. While the 23rd ruler Gautamiptura Satakarni is well known, there were 29 other rulers. One of the legendary kings was Srimukha, who was a Jain,” says another historian, who has studied the Early Deccan period. The extent and spread of Satavahana rule appeared like a puzzle without enough epigraphic evidence.

special correspondent,"Telangana is seeking to take a different path with its proposal to provide additional incentives to new industrial units that recruit more local candidates, skilled as well as semi-skilled. The decision not to go for reservation as some States have done is based on its emphasis on facilitating the process rather than achieving it through a mandate. While Telangana too has a compulsion of creating job opportunities for locals, just like other States, “we felt we should not do reservation,” Industries Secretary Jayesh Ranjan said about the proposal on additional incentives that the Cabinet had approved on Wednesday. Additional incentive above what is now being offered, be it on GST, power tariff and capital subsidy, would be given to new enterprises employing more people from the State. The guidelines and rules of the policy were likely to be readied in 10-15 days, the senior official said. Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh are among the States that opted for reservation of jobs for locals in the private sector. The decision did not go down well with industries and industry bodies. It is in this backdrop that Telangana decided to pursue a different path — a two-pronged approach to offer additional incentives and skilling youth. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao was keen on Telangana providing a different model to the country, Mr. Ranjan said. The focus is on creating an enabling mechanism. If the units do not take on board as many locals as required, they will not be eligible for additional incentives. But, it would not translate into their being penalised, he said. On whether views of industry were sought, Mr. Ranjan said “we know what they do not want.” The State government is considering engaging with ITIs, especially those in proximity to industrial clusters, to make them offer courses meeting the job requirements of the units. TASK (Telangana Academy for Skill and Knowledge) did this for the IT sector, “we need to do it for the manufacturing sector,” he said. The decision on additional incentives has come at a time when industry is looking forward to payment of pending incentives. Mr. Ranjan said the State Budget had provided for Rs. 1,500 crore towards clearing all incentives till last year. The COVID-19 outbreak and the resultant impact on revenues, however, came in the way of implementation. They would be paid once revenues improved, he added. Welcoming the proposal on additional incentives, FICCI Telangana State Council chairman T. Muralidharan said its successful implementation would depend on a robust procedure that transparently disclosed what was happening. On pending incentives, he said the Telangana government could consider creating a mechanism or an instrument with which industrial units could adjust the outstanding dues to them against other levies. Noting that the proposal was likely to reduce dependence on migrant workers, Telangana Industrialists Federation president K. Sudhir Reddy said the government should consider clearing the pending incentives of MSMEs first, possibly in tranches.",2020-08-09,TH32307814,HYDERABAD,TS sops for units employing locals,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ts-sops-for-units-employing-locals/article32307814.ece
K. Shiva Shanker,"The ongoing COVID-19 crisis has evoked a range of emotions in people, from helplessness and confusion to frustration and rage. At their wits’ end, many of them rhetorically ask, ‘when will the pandemic end?’. Senior officials in the Health department claim that COVID is now beyond its peak and cases are set to decline by month-end. In case of other districts, officials estimated that the cases will decline will start by end of September. However, this relief might not last for long as experts have predicted a second wave of COVID-19 pandemic. Till mid-July, a major chunk of the cases detected in the State were from GHMC. Some days, up to 80% of cases in a day were from the municipal limits. Special attention was given to the State capital and localities surrounding it. Over 1,000 cases a day were reported in GHMC till July 8. It dropped to below 1,000 on July 9 and started to gradually decline there on. In the past seven days, between 250 to 550 cases a day were recorded in the municipal limits. On Friday, only 21% of the total 2,256 cases were from the municipality. The rest were from other districts. “After hitting the peak, number of cases stabilise and will decline in coming days. Now, the cases in GHMC have stabilised. According to our estimation, cases will decline in GHMC by end of August. Now cases are surging in other districts. That is the nature of the virus. It will first hit densely populated cities, and then spread to two tier cities and thereafter in villages. But severity of cases in other districts might not be the same as witnessed in GHMC,” Director of Public Health, G. Srinivasa Rao said. Earlier, fewer cases in the State was attributed to low testing. Asked if number of tests to detect coronavirus conducted in GHMC limits is the same now as it was in early July, Dr Rao said the tests have increased by five to six times. “We are conducting 20,000 to 23,000 tests a day. Of those, around 60% tests are conducted in GHMC. Testing is being ramped up in other districts too. We are ready to conduct 40,000 tests per day,” the senior health official said. About a possible second wave, the Director of Public Health said they are prepared for the worst. He said the time when cases subside will be used to further bolster the infrastructure and resources.However, people were urged to continue maintaining precautions such as wearing masks and maintaining distance as negligence might lead to a spike in cases again.",2020-08-09,TH32307807,HYDERABAD,‘Cases in GHMC to dip by month-end’,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cases-in-ghmc-to-dip-by-month-end/article32307807.ece
Syed Mohammed,"A family of three, including two elderly COVID-19 patients, were allegedly forced out of an acquaintance’s home, where they had arrived to isolate themselves, by irate locals who objected to their presence in the neighbourhood. The family had arrived from Kollapur at the home of a relative in Kamala Nagar in Vanasthalipuram on August 5 after developing symptoms of the novel coronavirus where their accommodation was inadequate for home isolation. Their relative, Sai Gopal Sambaraju, who works with an IT giant, said, “Their reports came two days ago. The 86-year-old lady, and her son, who is over 60, have tested positive. The third person has tested negative. The house in Vanasthalipuram was empty and the owner, who is a relative, gave us permission to use it for self-isolation. Around 7.30 pm, I took an oxygen cylinder in my car and tried to move it into the house. Some locals who saw me began to glare at me and soon afterwards, questioned me about the family’s presence in the house and why they were brought for isolation there.” Mr Sambaraju alleged that after finding out the inmates had tested positive, several locals surrounded him and his sister, hurled abuses, and in a threatening tone asked them to vacate the house. He also claimed that the one of the locals threatened to damage their car and assault them if they did not comply, even as he said the temporary inhabitants had not stepped out of the house since their arrival. “The locals threatened to call ‘108’ to remove the family from house. I told them to give us an hour to vacate as there was an 86-year-old lady there. Then, police came and agreed with locals that we should leave. Eventually, we were forced to go with the family at 11.30 p.m. on Friday. They were moved to a quarantine centre in Gachibowli and had to pay Rs. 40,000 for seven days. My sister has registered a complaint with Vanasthipuram police,” he said. Vanasthalipuram police inspector K. Murali Mohan confirmed the incident. “They did not have permission from the District Medical and Health Officer to move the patient to that locality. The crowd there was of locals. We have made a general diary entry and no FIR has been registered yet,” he said. However, an official of the health department expressed surprise, and said no permission from the DMHO is required to move a COVID-19 positive case for isolation. “No DMHO has received any such instructions from the State government about giving permission for moving COVID-19 suspects or patients,” the official said. I told them to give us an hour to vacate as there was an 86-year-old lady there. Then, police came and agreed with locals that we should leave.

V. Geetanath,"It has been over three months since the Hyderabad Metro Rail (HMR) has come to a grinding halt when the countrywide lockdown was enforced on March 22 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. And, the wait for this public transport facility to start is likely to continue for some more time along with the city bus services with the constant rise in cases. It also means the loss making Rs. 20,000-crore project will only further sink into debt. L&T Metro Rail Hyderabad (L&TMRH) has already submitted project cost overrun details to the government of Rs. 3,756 crore and has been “pursuing the matter with the government for providing relief”. It has reported a loss of Rs. 382.21 crore for financial year of 2019-20 and a revenue of Rs. 598.20 crore as per the annual report and has warned that the continuing shutting down of services makes the current financial year predictions totally uncertain. The last three years of operations has got the company Rs. 1,142.41 crore from fares and another Rs. 228.16 crore for non-fare revenue from exploitation of commercial real estate. Before shutdown, HMR was carrying close to 5 lakh passengers and garnering revenue of about Rs. 40 crore a month running across three corridors of Miyapur to L.B. Nagar (Red Line), Jubilee Bus Station to MG Bus Station (Green Line) and Nagole to Raidurg (Blue Line). Earlier in February, the last remaining Corridor II stretch was launched for commercial operations completing the entire project with 69.2 kms of the metro rail system. Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited, the nodal agency of Telangana government, recommended the extension of scheduled completion date as defined under the Concession Agreement till June 30, 2020. What happens now is not clear. “Everything is tied to the Delhi Metro Rail services. If the service starts there, we can resume here too as the Union Home Ministry is involved.

Special Correspondent,"Members of the Independent Schools Managements’ Association (ISMA) in the State have sought clarity on the issue of collection of tuition fees and flexibility in conduct of online sessions for students of classes VI to VIII. In a letter addressed to the Commissioner, Department of School Education, Vadrevu Chinaveerabhadrudu, members of the association have pointed out that most of them are CBSE schools and they strictly adhere to the guidelines issued by CBSE and ICSE authorities from time to time. They said that in April, they followed the four weeks’ plan of online learning given by NCERT, which had also recommended an eight-week Alternate Academic Year plan from mid-June, which the schools in Andhra Pradesh could not follow due to instructions from local authorities. They said that clarity finally emerged on the issue after some of their members met Mr. Chinaveerabhadrudu. On the issue of fee collection, the ISMA members cited the orders of the A.P. School Education Regulatory and Monitoring Commission (APSERMC), which said that collection of fees before the commencement of new academic year was against the rules. They said that their academic year had already commenced as per the CBSE academic calendar. In yet another directive, the APSERMC asked school managements to pay full salaries to their staff but was silent on fee collection. They said that private unaided institutions like theirs would not be able to manage their expenditure without collecting fees from students, which is their only source of income. They also pointed out that the High Courts of Delhi, Punjab and Haryana, Kerala Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat had given their verdict in favour of fee collection recognising the fact that schools incur certain expenditure irrespective of whether they are functioning or not. They appealed to the Commissioner to give clear instructions on collection of tuition fees for the 2020-21 academic year. With regard to online classes, they said that CBSE authorities had allowed flexibility on the number of sessions to be conducted and the ISMA was trying its best to ensure that the students cope with the lost academic time on account of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Staff Reporter,"The Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) has reached a conclusion that the requirement of prior Environmental Clearance (EC) is not applicable for the Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Project (RLIP). K. Gopakumar and other EAC members, at a recent meeting, observed after detailed deliberations on the ECs granted to the Telugu Ganga Project, Srisailam Right Bank Canal and Galeru Nagari Sujala Sravanthi projects that the RLIP was not a new one and it did not fall under any category listed in the Schedule of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification of 2006. The EAC stated that the RLIP had also no power generation component involved and it did not qualify as an expansion / modernisation project either, official sources said. Besides, the committee said that the EC letters of the above three schemes to which RLIP would be feeding water were taken by the Government of Andhra Pradesh. A review of the EC conditions contained in the letters revealed that changing from gravity discharge to pumping should not be considered as a change in scope as the ECs issued to these schemes did not restrict them to gravity discharge only. Another factor is that since there is no change in the cultivable command area, the RLIP does not qualify to be covered by the aforementioned EIA notification. The EAC concluded that as long as A.P. was restricted to drawing its allocated share of water, environmental impact of the availability of water on other users was not envisaged. Further, A.P. shall install pumps capable of pumping only 3 tmcft (excluding safety margins) to ensure it drew only that much quantity per day, the committee reported.",2020-08-09,TH32307976,VIJAYAWADA,"RLIP does not require prior environmental nod, says panel",https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rlip-does-not-require-prior-environmental-nod-says-panel/article32307976.ece

K. SRINIVASA RAO,"Many COVID positive persons in Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts, who have been asked to quarantine themselves at home owing to lack of beds in the designated hospitals, have complained to the authorities over lack of proper assistance. A few patients in Saluru in Vizianagaram district were agitated over the inordinate delay in taking them to the hospital. They had informed the authorities that there was no possibility of them isolating at home they did not have separate bathrooms or extra rooms. But, they say they were made to wait until beds were available. Though 6,000 beds are available in the hospitals in the district, most of them are in COVID Care Centres where medical facilities are not at par with that of those in the hospitals. In this background, the government authorities are allowing the patients to be quarantined at home after taking their consent. Some, who are not willing to get admitted to the hospitals, can also opt for home quarantine option. “After results turned out positive, the government authorities are supposed to shift the patients to the COVID-19 hospital. However, the officials asked everyone to follow home quarantine. It may lead to spread of the disease to others,” said Bhisetti Babji, State executive president of Lok Satta Party. As many as 11 persons in Padala street of Jami mandal recovered from COVID-19 while staying at home. Their recovery was aided by the assistance from the health staff. However, many others have not been receiving such support. “Private hospitals are fleecing patients with their special packages for those staying in home quarantine. The hospitals charge up to Rs. 10,000 per day for providing medical assistance through ‘video-call’ facility. That is why, the government should provide treatment to patients in COVID-19 hospitals instead of making them to be in home quarantine,” he added. Srikakulam Collector J.Nivas directed all the COVID-19 hospitals to arrange for immediate availability of beds for patients. He had observed that the beds were not being sanitized immediately after the discharge of existing patients. It is also leading to non-availability of beds at hospitals. “Apart from beds, round-the-clock availability of doctors, nurses and staff is very important.

Staff Reporter,"With the number of COVID infections “hitting the peak” of the pandemic curve, the State has adopted a proactive strategy of treating all persons with certain COVID symptoms irrespective of the test result to avoid deaths based on clinical diagnosis. Special Chief Secretary (Health, Medical and Family Welfare) K.S. Jawahar Reddy told a press conference on Saturday that Andhra Pradesh had entered the peak of the pandemic curve, and several districts were already at peak of infections while others are about to hit it. “Most districts such as East Godavari, West Godavari, Kurnool, Anantapur and Guntur have already entered the peak stage and others are about to witness the peak of infections. As we enter the sixth month of the pandemic, it is a natural consequence to see the peak,” Dr. Reddy said. “Having less than 1% mortality rate, the pandemic has been well managed clinically in the State. The focus is now on reducing the mortality rate further by identifying severely ill persons even without testing them for COVID,” Dr. Reddy said. “Persons with continuous fever for three to four days, breathlessness, and oxygen saturation level below 94% will be considered as severe symptomatic cases. Even without testing, they will be immediately admitted to hospitals and treated. To identify them, we have given pulse oxymeters to ANMs and with the help of ward and village volunteers and ASHA workers patients would be identified at the ground level,” Dr. Reddy said “We have three parameters in place to avoid deaths. One is having a minimum of six to seven day treatment window. Second, following all treatment protocols and medication available. The third is to not allow any critical patient to die without being treated with ventilator support,” he said. “In most cases, deaths are occurring within three days of admission. Sometimes it is on the same day of admission. This is because of late reporting and identification of the persons infected. I appeal to the public to come forward and dial 104 or local volunteers and ANMs if they are experiencing severe symptoms,” Dr. Reddy said. About the age group of persons who succumbed to COVID, he said that about 70% are of 40 to 60 years of age group with and without comorbidities and remaining were cases of patients aged less than 40 years. He said there were over 4,000 containment clusters in the State at present and nearly 60% of them were in urban areas. Seeking cooperation of the public, Dr. Reddy said that every person was prone to COVID infection and the only things that could save us is “COVID appropriate behaviour” and “non-pharmaceutical public health measures”. He said the State had already begun sero-surveillance survey in Krishna, East Godavari, Anantapur and Nellore districts through CLIA tests, where 3,750 people in each district would be tested for antibodies.

Mr. Jayadev said that the people of the State had lost Hyderabad which was the growth engine. The new State was primarily agrarian with very few industries. This meant there were limited employment opportunities. The most developed city in the new State, Visakhapatnam, could not compete with the other major cities in the region such as Hyderabad, Bangalore and Chennai. The requirement was to develop a growth engine for the State, which could accelerate development and put the State on a path of progress. Even after being on the back foot, the TDP developed the State by bringing in new industrial investments leading to new employment opportunities, he said. To meet the requirement of high-skilled labour for these companies, many central and private universities were invited to set up their campuses in the State.

Special Correspondent,"The show of strength by the followers of former Tadipatri MLA J.C. Prabhakar Reddy and his son Ashmit Reddy while coming out of the Kadapa Central Prison on Thursday prompted the police to conduct a ‘kavathu’ (march) using 25 vehicles. While entering the district limits, Mr. Prabhakar Reddy allegedly threatened a Circle Inspector, and based on his complaint, the TDP leader was arrested and sent to jail on Friday. In view of these developments, restrictions were imposed on the movement of people in Tadipatri town under Sections 144 and 30. The police personnel from various wings such as Armed Reserve from Chittoor, Kurnool and Anantapur districts conducted the march to instil confidence among the general public and to send a message that flouting COVID-19 norms would attract stringent action, Tadipatri Deputy Superintendent of Police A.

S. Anil Radhakrishnan,"A full-scale safety audit of Calicut International Airport should be carried out by the Civil Aviation Ministry to ensure safety of flyers and hassle-free flight operations, former Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) E.K. Bharat Bhusan has said. “Such a safety audit will be able to clear the apprehensions that prevail among the flyers, operating airlines, and other aviation stakeholders on various safety aspects in the wake of the overshooting of the tabletop runway by the Air India Express B-737 aircraft last night,” Mr. Bhusan, a 1979 batch Kerala cadre IAS officer, who superannuated as Chief Secretary, told . Mr. Bhusan said the safety audit would also clear the concerns about the exact nature and whether relaxations had been given for the 240-m ‘runway end safety area’ (RESA) and the 60-m strip on both ends of the runway. While serving as the DGCA, Mr. Bhusan was also responsible for developing a detailed domestic safety protocol for aviation, adopted in line with international norm, and aimed at optimal maintenance of aircraft and airports. Mr. Bhushan said the runway had several restrictions on account of various factors and hence the maintenance and recarpeting by the airport authorities should be looked into closely. The reported permission granted by the DGCA to the airlines, including two foreign carriers, to operate wide-bodied aircraft to Calicut should be looked into as it was a risky affair, he said. The need for the safety audit assumed significance against the backdrop of the DGCA’s show-cause notice to the Airport Director on July 11 last year after it found ‘various critical safety lapses’ in different places, including cracks on the 2,860-m runway, water stagnation, and excessive rubber deposits. Currently, a member of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Ernakulam, Mr. Bhusan said the solution was to go for land acquisition to increase the runway length. “The State should take the lead with local and political support as it is a thickly populated area,” Mr. Bhusan, who started his career as Subcollector, Malappuram, said.",2020-08-09,TH32307880,THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,Safety audit of airport needed: former DGCA,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/safety-audit-of-airport-needed-former-dgca/article32307880.ece

Staff Reporter,"At a time when the city is facing the twin threats of monsoon-time vector diseases and COVID-19, the city Corporation is all set to step up its waste management-at-source activities by popularising kitchen bins. Mayor K. Sreekumar said that kitchen bins that cost Rs. 1,800 each would be provided free of cost to households to promote waste treatment at source. Mr. Sreekumar said here on Friday that the dumping of unsegregated biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste in public spaces can lead to the spread of vector diseases. During this pandemic period, the kitchen bin is a more practical method to dispose of waste as it reduces interactions with waste collectors, keeping these workers safe too. For technical support in setting up and maintaining kitchen bins, Haritha Karma Senas have been appointed in all wards. A green technician for every 300 houses has also been appointed. The service providers will collect the non biodegradable waste as per the Corporation’s collection calendar from households which have installed kitchen bins.

S.R. Praveen,"Even though Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) has often got the least preference from the Central government in spectrum allocations and technology upgrades, the public sector telecom company has time and again proved its social commitment. When the landslip-hit Pettimudy in Idukki district was cut off from communication on Friday, hampering rescue efforts, BSNL workers were quick to restore it, despite the challenging conditions. The nearest point of optic fibre connectivity from Pettimudy is around 30 kilometres away in Rajamala. Even at this point, only BSNL has connectivity, as private players often stay away from the regions in the interiors. But since extending the optic fibre network to the remote Pettimudy was impractical, the BSNL has been using the satellite connectivity method to provide a mobile network for those living in the (housing lines of tea garden workers). Early on Friday, as soon as they got information about the communication breakdown that was hampering rescue efforts, a team led by Junior Telecom Officer, Pettimudy, set out to Pettimudy. With a key bridge from the Munnar side being washed away, they had to take a dangerous forest path, part of which was negotiated in a vehicle provided by the Forest Department, and partly on foot. “We had feared that the tower itself might have been washed off. It turned out that the satellite antenna was completely damaged and there was no power supply. The repairs were done and service was restored using generator power supply, as power lines were yet to be restored. But even with the original bandwidth, it was tough to handle the call traffic. So, I contacted the higher ups in Thiruvananthapuram, Bengaluru and later Delhi, from where we got approval to increase the bandwidth by four times, with which 2,000 calls can be handled every hour,” says Francis C. Jacob, Principal General Manager, BSNL. At the normal bandwidth, it costs the BSNL anywhere between Rs. 11 lakh to Rs. 15 lakh annually in rent to maintain the satellite connectivity. The revenue from this area is much lesser than that, yet the company still provides connectivity to the remotest of locations as part of its social obligation. “The BSNL Employees Union had appealed to all its members to be on the field during this hour of crisis, despite the hardships we face. It is in such times that the public realise the importance of the survival of PSUs like BSNL,” says BSNL EU Kerala Circle Secretary C.

A small respite, however, was that the district also registered its highest number recoveries from COVID-19 on a single day with as many as 777 people testing negative. There were currently 3,022 people being treated for the disease in the district. Among the new COVID-19 cases, as many as 468 have been attributed to local transmission. The source of infection in 33 of them are unknown. Seven health workers have also been infected. The coastal belt continued to witness a resurgence of COVID-19 cases after a lull as was the trend in the last few days. A bulk of the cases that were reported on Saturday were from the critical containment zones. The coastal hamlet of Anjuthengu appeared to be the worst hit with 125 people including the panchayat president and two other members testing positive from among 476 people who were subjected to antigen tests on the day. The total number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 in the region since Thursday is 302 while as many as 1,270 people were tested during the period. With the Anjuthengu grama panchayat president testing positive, Attingal municipal chairman M. Pradeep, the chairman of the health standing committee, municipal secretary, and a few others officials who had taken part in a cremation along with the former on Friday went into self-quarantine for seven days. The Anjuthengu grama panchayat president had also visited the municipal office in connection with conducting the final rites of an Anjuthengu native in the municipality crematorium. During his briefing, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said rising incidence of cases necessitated the extension of stringent containment efforts. He added that the trend could not be interpreted as a failure of the triple lockdown imposed in the State capital. However, pointing out that there has been a let-up in containment measures, he said it could take more time to salvage the situation from worsening any further. Mr. Vijayan also minced no words when he criticised the attack of a COVID first-line treatment centre (FLTC) at Pulluvila on Saturday. Referring to the demands made to close down the facility, the Chief Minister said that it was not up to the public to decide where FLTCs should be established. “Such treatment centres have been found to be necessary all over. They should not be seen as centres that could lead to a proliferation of COVID-19, but those meant to counter such a possibility. The public must refrain from falling prey to falsehoods propagated by a minority. Attacks as these are the most heinous crime meted out to the society,” he said.

While the floodwater that had submerged Pampa-Triveni, the base camp of the Sabarimala temple, receded gradually during the day, the water level in the Pampa dam continued to rise because of the incessant overnight rain in the forests. The district administration sounded a blue alert for the people living on the banks of the Pampa after water level in the reservoir here reached 982 metres early Saturday. The maximum water level in the Pampa dam has been fixed at 986.33 metres. At the same time, water level in the Kakki-Anathodu reservoir in Sabarigiri stood just over half of its capacity.

Staff Reporter,"A full-scale drill conducted seven years ago at the Calicut International Airport for assessing its preparedness in meeting emergency situations proved beneficial for a number of emergency medical care technicians, doctors and other first respondents to address the challenge effectively on Friday night. The drill which was organised in 2012 by the Active Network Group of Emergency Life Savers (ANGELS) in association with the Airports Authority of India, Indian Medical Association, the police and fire force departments had managed to identify a number of safety requirements and challenges. Suggestions to address such findings had been submitted to the authorities after the event. ANGELS was then emerging as a trained group of ambulance drivers with competence in handling emergency situations. “It was a big experience as I was then involved in the field-level coordination of the drill in my capacity as ANGELS executive director. The situation was simulated by burning about 5,000 litres of aviation fuel,” said P.P. Venugopal, chief of emergency medicine at Aster MIMS Hospital, which cared for over 40 of the injured passengers on Friday. It was quite distressing that Friday’s crash took place exactly at the same location where the drill was carried out in 2012, he told . The drill had witnessed the participation of a large number of health workers. It was then claimed to be the biggest ever drill conducted at the airport by complying with the guidelines of the Disaster Management Authority. There were also similar drills in later years for auditing safety situations with the participation of airport staff and the Central Industrial Security Force personnel. Dr. Venugopal said the biggest challenge for his medical team on Friday was to manage the critical care needs amid the COVID-19 scare. “There were 150 persons, including doctors, emergency medical technicians and nursing staff wearing PPE kits to handle the situation.

He jumped on to the wing and then to the nearby road before he collapsed and was later carried away by rescue workers. “I had a doubt that the flight may catch fire in no time. Hence, I hurried out”, he had told his brother-in-law, who is his bystander at the Government General Hospital at Kozhikode Beach. He thanks the seat belt that saved him from being thrown around during the crash.

Biju Govind,"The Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is likely to revisit its decision to allow Calicut International Airport to operate wide-bodied aircraft in the wake of an Air India Express flight from Dubai overshooting the runway on Friday. Sources said the no-objection certificate (NOC) issued to three airlines — Air India, Saudia (Saudi Arabian Airlines), and Emirates — based on the adequacy of safety assessment and mitigation measures to ensure safety of Code E aircraft would have to be reviewed shortly. It was in December 2018 Saudia secured the approval of the DGCA to operate Boeing 777-200 and Airbus 330-300 aircraft. The operation of wide-bodied aircraft was banned at the airport from May 2015 in the wake of the Court of Inquiry report on the Air India Express Boeing 737 crash in Mangaluru in May 2010. One of the major reasons was that the tabletop runway had only a length of 2,850 metres designed to operate only narrow-bodied (Code- D) aircraft and that the runway end safety area (RESA) of the airport was inadequate for the operation of wide-bodied (Code E) aircraft. The approval then, the sources said, had been obtained due to political pressure so as to benefit the lakhs of air passengers to the Middle East and the restoration of Haj embarkation point to the Calicut airport. Incidentally, the runway was reduced by 150 metres to facilitate the RESA expansion to the mandatory 240m x 90m as stipulated by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.The approval of the DGCA had come with multiple riders, including restricting the operation of flights only during the day time for an initial period of six months. sThereafter, the DGCA will review the situation for the night operations, the sources said. The Airports Authority of India had then been asked to stick to the standard operating procedures (SOP) such as ‘regulatory take off weight’. For Boeing 777-300, the weight should not exceed 290 tonnes and for Boeing 777-200, 257 tonnes. Further, the DGCA said the approval would be subjected to review after three years. Also the onus of the disabled aircraft removal plan had to be jointly put on the airline and the Calicut airport authorities in case of incidents such as tyre burst and aircraft running off the runway or taxiway.",2020-08-09,TH32307872,Kozhikode,Wide-bodied jets likely to skip Calicut,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/wide-bodied-jets-likely-to-skip-calicut/article32307872.ece

In Azhiyoor panchayat, the affected families from six wards including the coastal area were shifted to safer locations. Though there was a brief respite from torrential rain on Saturday morning, major tributaries of the Kabani river, including the Mananthavady, Nugu, Kalindi, and the Panamaram rivers, are in spate in many low-lying areas of the district. A meeting of the district disaster management authority decided to raise the three shutters of the Karapuzha reservoir to 25 cm if the water level increased further. The Indian Meteorology Department has issued red alert in the district for Sunday. Torrential rain along with wind lashed the entire district on Saturday. Low lying areas are under water. The coastal belt of the district is facing the fury of monsoon. Control rooms, working 24 hours, have been opened at taluks and collectorate in the district. They are: Collectorate 1077 (toll free), 0487 2462424, 9447074424; Thrissur taluk (0487 2331443); Thalappilly (04884-233226); Mukundapuram (0480-2825259); Chavakkad (0487-2507350); Kodungallur (0480-2802336); Chalakudy (0480-2705800); Kunnamkulam (04885 225200, 225700).

NAVAMY SUDHISH,"This year they will have to brave the extra threat of the pandemic and loss of livelihood due to the extended fishing ban. But none of this could stop the fishers of Kollam from leaving for the flood-hit parts of Pathanamthitta with their boats on Saturday morning. Twenty-four fishers and 10 boats from the district are currently at Pathanamthitta, a reserve task force all set for any contingency. Many of them were part of the rescue teams in the 2018 and 2019 floods, but this year their task seems all the more challenging. “We know about the virus, but now saving lives is more important,” says 51-year-old Joseph, who was in the rain-ravaged Aranmula during the last two floods. He agrees his community is already in dire straits due to the fishing ban. “First the pandemic and then the weather stopped us from venturing into the sea. But as someone who had seen the misery of flood victims I had no doubts. I am not afraid of the disease,” says the fisher from Moothakara. It was during a meeting of Harbour Management Society on Friday that the request from Pathanamthitta came up. “The meeting was to fix the rates of fish after the ban and at first some people were a little apprehensive. But despite all the anxieties, they agreed to go and they were given essential supplies and safety products. They will stay in Pathanamthitta till the situation changes. We can arrange more fishers and boats in case of emergency,” says Kollam district Matsya Thozhilali Union president H. Basil Lal. The boats were transported in trucks and the rescue activities will be held by adhering to COVID-19 protocols. When a request came from Pathanamthitta, the fishers decided to go there, setting aside pandemic worries.",2020-08-09,TH32307940,KOLLAM,Kollam rushes an ‘expert’ team to Pathanamthitta,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kollam-rushes-an-expert-team-to-pathanamthitta/article32307940.ece

There cannot be any justification for delay in the initial phase of the project, and the government’s promise that the project will be implemented in a time-bound manner cannot be taken at face value, the statement added. “The agreement with GJ Eco Power was cancelled after it took four years to grant all approvals to the firm.

K.A. Martin,"Kerala land has lost its “immunity” and landslips and related phenomena are here to stay. The State must prepare to deal with it for a long time to come, V.R. Haridas, hydrogeologist, who studied the August 2019 Kavalappara and Puthumala landslips as adviser, Climate Adaptive Project for the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development. says. The soil structure has changed drastically. It is no longer “immune” to events such as intense rain, as witnessed over the past two years and this year, Dr. Haridas, drawing an analogy from COVID-19, says. “Land will continue to slip and slide and destroy lives unless pre-emptive measures are adopted. Soil is sensitive like the human body. Any interference with its nature and structure will have its consequences. One of the most common human activities has been massive deforestation, mostly for plantations. Mono-cropping and quarrying are other serious interferences with the structure and lay of the land,” he says. When trees are cut and their roots are left to rot, they decay over decades to form pipes through which the soil substrata is directly injected with rainwater. This results in the formation of a sludge-like slippery layer that oozes to the hard rock resulting in the layer above the hardest rock losing grip and stability. The conditions this week have been ideal for this type of phenomenon. Kerala’s rain is traditionally over a period of two to two-and-a-half months. But now about half the 3,000 mm of annual rain is received in about one or two weeks. It is like pelting the earth with stones, he says, pointing out that the or yarn rain, which irrigated the land at a pace so suited to farming activities, is a thing of the past for Kerala. Munnar and neighbouring areas received about 30 cm of rain over 24 hours in the last couple of days. Any volume of rain above 24 cm is classified as extremely heavy. Dr. Haridas says the phenomenon of piping from large-scale root decay after deforestation takes about three decades. This was quite obvious in places where landslips had occurred in the past, including at Kavalappara, where 59 people lost their lives. He says though landslips are unpredictable, warning signs, mostly in the form of smaller land dislocation, should be heeded to if we are to avoid massive destruction of life and property.",2020-08-09,TH32307874,Kochi,"‘Kerala land has lost immunity, landslips to stay’",https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kerala-land-has-lost-immunity-landslips-to-stay/article32307874.ece
G. Krishnakumar,"Kerala has to come up with bold imaginative, but humane, initiatives on environmental land management and new utilisation rules for land and water while maintaining the sustainability of drainage basins considering all related uncertainties, C.P. Rajendran, geoscientist and Professor at the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research in Bengaluru, has said. “Land use zoning regulation that incorporates landslip susceptibility data should be made mandatory. The data that are made available by agencies like the Geological Survey of India indicate that out of the approximately 39,000 square km area of Kerala, the hill area having slopes higher than 10 degree constitutes about 19,000 square km and most of the scarps are thinly forested and further weakened by human activities,” he said in an email interview a day after the Rajamala landslip tragedy in Idukki district. Prof. Rajendran says the landslip susceptibility map of the State will help the administrators to understand what type of landslip size is expected in different areas. “I don’t think there is any dearth of scientific data on landslip vulnerability in the State although some specific geotechnical and geological studies may be required in some areas. To my knowledge, several detailed technical reports have been submitted to the State government at various times. It is high time that we came up with a programme that will enable us to use such data to mitigate the hazard,” he says. He says it is important that both the local and State authorities should be relying on scientific reports on landslip vulnerabilities to reach decisions on land allocations for constructions in the hill districts of Idukki and Wayanad. “In these decisions, local soil properties and slope stability should be important factors to be considered, rather than political expediency. A blueprint that demarcates areas suitable for habitation and those to be left untouched should help in strictly implementing the basic tenets of land zonation,” he says. Prof. Rajendran suggests a comprehensive master plan on land utilisation strategy based on a clear environmental vision at macro and micro levels to ensure that encroachment is minimal. “These documents should contain clear guidelines for constructions, including recommended designs of houses that will match with local landscape and scenery,” he says.",2020-08-09,TH32307879,Kochi,‘Use landslip susceptibility data to mitigate hazard’,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/use-landslip-susceptibility-data-to-mitigate-hazard/article32307879.ece
Special Correspondent,"The flood situation in low-lying areas close to the banks of Periyar and Muvattupuzha rivers eased on Saturday, even as intermittent rain prompted the district administration to continue vigil and shift people from vulnerable locations to safer destinations. The water level in the Muvattupuzha river remained at the danger mark after six shutters of the Malankara dam were raised at 11 a.m. The reading at the gauging station at Kochangadi was 11.51 metres as against the danger level of 10.51 metres in the afternoon. Revenue officials at Muvattupuzha said floodwaters had entered houses at Kacherithazham and Kochangadi. However, it was less severe compared to the levels recorded on Friday. As many as 23 families were shifted to four relief camps, they said. The situation at Kothamangalam improved owing to moderate rainfall till afternoon. Floodwaters that entered houses in Jawahar Colony have started receding, according to Revenue officials. However, over 60 families continue to remain at seven camps opened in the region as a precautionary measure. Meanwhile, the water level in the Periyar near the Marthandavarma Bridge in Aluva was 2.3 metres against the 2.5-metre flood warning level, while the corresponding figures near the Mangalapuzha Bridge were 2.55 metres and 3.3 metres respectively.

Payments for completed work have not been made to contractors for the past 35 months, from September 2017 onwards, said a statement issued by the association. Repeated entreaties to the corporation and the State government to release their dues have gone in vain, and most contractors are left with little finances of their own to continue work, the statement added. The government owes around Rs. 30 crore to contractors for work taken up under the Plan Fund. “Contractors have not been able to bear the burden of paying for material and equipment, as well as handing out salaries to workers. Some bills from cleaning of drains and canals from 2018 onwards have not even been prepared,” said K.A. David, secretary of the association. The association squarely blamed the corporation’s five-year-long inefficiency for their plight. Work on widening some canals, besides laying slabs and some road and walkway work, will now be halted, Mr. David said.

Special Correspondent,"Torrential rain in the catchment areas of Cauvery and Kabini rivers has increased the volume of inflow into major reservoirs in the region since the last one week. This has also led to high rate of outflow, which is inundating the downstream regions of major dams in the Cauvery basin. According to the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC), the cumulative discharge from Kabini and KRS from June 1 till August 8 is 39 tmcft and this is almost equal to the June and July quota of Karnataka’s obligation to lower riparian State of Tamil Nadu. But out of this, 16 tmcft of water has been released from Kabini reservoir alone between August 4 and 8 and this is set to increase further due to extreme weather conditions in Wayanad region of Kerala, which is the catchment area for Kabini. The inflow into the reservoir was at the rate of 64,449 cusecs and the outflow was 70,600 cusecs on Saturday. An outflow of nearly 11,500 cusecs for 24 hours equals 1 tmcft. The water level was 2,277.9 feet against the full reservoir level of 2,284 feet. The cumulative outflow from the Krishnaraja Sagar (KRS) was 14 tmcft from June 1 to August 8. But this will increase significantly during the next 48 hours as the KRS is nearing the full reservoir level and there is no let up in rains in the catchment area of the Cauvery. The inflow to the dam as measured at 11.30 a.m. on Saturday was at the rate of 77,848 cusecs and the outflow was pegged at 74,642 cusecs.

Karnataka Bureau,"About 15 metres of the railway track embankment between Sakleshpur and Kadagaravalli Railway Stations on Hassan-Mangaluru railway line was washed away on Thursday following a landslip from the adjacent National Highway 75. A release from South Western Railway’s Mysuru division here said the landslip triggered further landslips next to the railway line. Rainwater from the road began gushing through the railway track uprooting a tree and bringing lot of muck. It also caused erosion of the banks of a nearby minor bridge and washed away the embankment. Protective works done earlier were damaged. Railway engineers have taken up restoration work. Meanwhile, after five days of heavy downpour, the intensity of the rain reduced in several parts of Malnad region on Saturday. Water has receded in some flooded areas and elected representatives have begun to visit the rain-hit areas. Parts of Koppa, N.R. Pura, Mudigere, Sringeri in Chikkamagaluru, Thirthahalli, Sagar, Hosanagar in Shivamogga, and Sakleshpur and Alur continued to receive rains, though with reduced intensity.

Special Correspondent,"Residents of Kundapur in Udupi district, who were aghast over continuous artificial flooding on NH66 inside the town, poured their woes to Minister for Ports and Fisheries Kota Srinivas Poojary on Saturday. Mr. Poojary visited Basrur Moorkai area on NH66 at the rquest of the Rashtriya Heddari Horata Samiti. The residents pointed out that they have been suffering from artificial flooding for over six years owing to the slow pace of the construction of a four-lane highway. Now that vehicles have been diverted on the service roads, to facilitate construction of main carriageways and underpasses, rainwater gets accumulated on the service roads thereby forcing vehicles and people to move through knee-deep waters. Mr. Poojary said he would speak to the district administration as well as NHAI officials to get the problem solved immediately. Kundapura Assistant Commissioner K.

Anil Kumar Sastry,"Friday night’s air crash at Kozhikode International Airport in Kerala, which claimed 18 lives, has brought back memories of a similar tragedy on May 22, 2010 in Mangaluru, which also has a table-top airport. Of the 160 passengers and six crew members, 158 including all crew members had died in Managaluru after the aircraft overshot the runway, fell into a gorge, and caught fire. The casualty in Kozhikode was less as the aircraft did not catch fire. However, an expert who facilitated the inquiry back then claimed that causes that led to the crash of Air India Express Boeing 737 in Mangaluru was vastly different in terms of cause and infrastructure of the two locations, besides the casualties they resulted in. M.R. Vasudev, former director of Mangaluru International Airport (MIA) who facilitated the inquiry of Mangaluru crash and later was posted its director, said the crash was due to error by the Captain as he ignored the co-pilot’s suggestion to go around instead of immediate landing. “Captain Zlatko Glusica had just come back from a 21-day-long leave after which Air India should have given refresher training. He was also given the round trip duty, flying from Mangaluru to Dubai and back, involving about eight hours of flying with limited rest,” recalled Mr. Vasudev. Dozing off in the cabin, he ignored co-pilot H.S. Ahluwalia’s request not to land immediately and go around instead. “At Kozhikode, however, the aircraft appears to have skidded on the slippery runway and fell into the gorge following heavy rains,” he said. MIA has had several infrastructure changes after the tragic incident. Mr. Vasudev said that MIA built 240 m of Runway End Safety Area (RESA) on both the ends of the 2,450-m-long runway following the Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s directions after the crash. In contrast, Kozhikode airport has just 90 m of RESA. RESA is meant to arrest the speed of aircraft if it shoots the runway. The existing instrument landing system at MIA was fixed inside the earth as per DGCA recommendations, though the proposal to extend the runway for 2,700 m is in limbo for want of land acquisition. “The existing facilities at MIA were more than enough to handle aircraft of the desired size,” Mr. Vasudev said, adding it was distinctly different from that of Kozhikode. Work on construction of a parallel taxiway for 2,400-m length to reduce the waiting time for aircraft is on while 1,200-m taxiway is ready. Meanwhile, MIA Director V.V. Rao told the Airports Authority of India has executed all works as suggested by DGCA to ensure safe handling of flights. There have been periodical inspection of facilities by the DGCA and no deficiencies were found. Mangaluru crash was due to error by the Captain as he ignored the co-pilot’s suggestion to go around instead of immediate landing. At Kozhikode, however, the aircraft appears to have skidded on the slippery runway and fell into the gorge following heavy rains.M.R.

The police on Saturday arrested the victim’s son and three others whom he had allegedly paid to kill his father.

Staff Reporter,"Even as a beleaguered tourism industry grapples with the massive hit it has taken because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Karnataka is set to get a new tourism policy for the next five years. The final meeting to discuss the Draft Tourism Policy 2020-25 was held recently. The policy is expected to address aspects such as attracting more domestic and international travellers to place Karnataka on the tourist map of the country, giving a boost to various kinds of tourism such as heritage, wildlife, spiritual, cultural, adventure, coastal, nature, health, and agriculture, looking into the development of tourist destinations, providing basic amenities, and revenue generation. With its tagline ‘one State, many worlds,’ Karnataka has often been compared to the neighbouring Kerala and Goa, which are extremely popular among domestic and international travellers. Minister for Tourism C.T. Ravi told that the new policy also takes up an evaluation of last year’s policy to see what has been implemented and what hasn’t, and why, apart from including a road map to implement the new policy by year. “We need the concurrence of the Finance Department, Planning Department, and then the Cabinet. Once [it is] through, the Chief Minister will release the policy by this month-end or the next month,” he said. Asked about what to expect from the new policy, he said to attract international travellers, entry fee into south Indian States could be waived through a mutual understanding to create a circuit to facilitate travellers between different south Indian States. In addition to this, district-level task forces will be initiated to make planning more inclusive, letting them decide on the dos and don’ts for those destinations instead of centralising them in Bengaluru, he said. The impact of COVID-19 has also been factored in for the initial survival and revival of the industry. “We have made a few changes to the subsidy application. A demand survey will be carried out as to where a budget hotel or resort needs to come up. Based on the fulfilment of conditions, we will give subsidy. Where there is abnormal growth, no subsidy is required. Other than through a policy, travel agents will be roped in with attractive packages to facilitate more tourists into the State, as the maximum number of tourists go through them,” Mr. Ravi said. The entire tourism ecosystem has had a non-starter season this year with the pandemic washing out the peak summer vacation period.

Tanu Kulkarni,"With schools restricting the duration of online classes, an increasing number of working parents are signing their children up for private online tuition and extracurricular classes to keep them engaged. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in teachers and trained professionals offering a variety of classes, ranging from coding to painting to dance and even football coaching lessons. This is over and above the “traditional” online classes such as training for competitive exams and academics. While many of the companies offering classes have switched to online mode because of the pandemic, many teachers and artists who haveseen a reduction in their salaries or lost their jobs have decided to open their own enterprises and have designed online classes. Families who can afford it are using the opportunity to acquire new skills. Mitali Joshi, a designer and digital marketing expert who founded the Bengaluru-based company Your Future Skill, has started conducting Adobe Illustrator courses for students. “I decided to do this on the side, and have already conducted training for two batches. It is a five-day course which will end with an assessment. Students willget a certificate,” she said. Karan Bajaj, founder and CEO, WhiteHat Jr., which conducts courses in coding, said they had seen a surge in demand for online classes. They have four levels where children learn logic, structure, and algorithms to eventually make animations and applications. “While the beginner course involves building apps with logic and abstraction, at the intermediate level students learn to develop advanced art and single-character games. They finally move to the advanced and professional level courses,” he said. Parents pointed out that they were signing their children up for more extracurricular activities as they were saving a lot of time on commute. “Before the pandemic, my teenage son had football classes twice a week, and a weekly painting class. Now, besides these two classes, I have also signed him up for coding and yoga as he needs to be occupied through the day,” said Ramya S. Parents acknowledgedthat the time their children were spending sitting in front of a computer screen had shot up dramatically, but there was no other choice. Not all online classes are popular, especially those trying to coach children in sports. For instance, online football classes involve students learning and practising skills such as ball control, single leg tic tac, double leg tic tac, step over, and so on. Renu Bhatt, one of the founders of Stadium FC which was started in 2010, said they had seen a reduction in the number of children opting for online classes compared to previous years. “We have designed drills that students can do in a small area. We focus on their fitness and technique, and students can take the classes from a small room in their house. Although we have kept in mind logistics, online football coaching is not a big hit among students. They want to come out and play on the field,” she said.",2020-08-09,TH32307659,Bengaluru,Surge in demand for online extracurricular activities,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/surge-in-demand-for-online-extracurricular-activities/article32307659.ece

Special Correspondent,"Ancestors of many residents of Bharathi Nagar near Kayathar had moved to a tea estate close to Rajamalla in Idukki district a century ago as there was no scope for farming operations in the dry region of Kayathar. They believed that tea gardens in the Western Ghats would make their life bright. When the first generation got a decent income, the next generation followed suit. While elders returned to Bharathi Nagar, their children stayed in the estate. Most of their wards too lived in Bharathi Nagar so that they could go to school. But on Thursday night, they came to know that landslides had buried their relatives. Officials say 55 persons had died but residents say 72 had died. “As educational institutions are yet to open, most of the children were with their parents in the tea estate only to be buried,” says Antony, Kayathar town secretary of Puthiya Thamizhagam, who has lost 15 close relatives. A girl, who is residing in her grandparents’ house in Bharathi Nagar and studying in Class 10 and did not go to the tea estate as she could not get e-pass, has lost her parents, an elder brother and two sisters. The family of Shanmugaiah, 60, lost 12 persons including his children and grandchildren. Retrieving the bodies of victims will be a Herculean task and relatives here say that bodies may be buried there itself. Like Bharathi Nagar, nearby Govindapuram, Pillaiyarnaththam and Thalaiyaalnadanthaankulam villages have also lost their near ones. Eight people from Nadu Pillaiyaarkulam near Maanur in Tirunelveli district have been buried alive in the landslide at Pettimudy in Idukki district in Kerala. District Revenue Officer A.

Special Correspondent,"The Public Works Department has started removing the thick growth of water hyacinth on the city stretch of the Uyyakondan canal. Though the canal runs a distance of about 71 km from Pettavaithalai to Vazhavanthankottai, the Public Works Department (River Conservation Division) officials said that water hyacinth, a thick and dense weed, grows extensively on the city stretch of the canal, particularly from the Puthur aqueduct (near Kuzhumayi Amman temple) to Ariyamangalam.

With nearly 700 cusecs of water being discharged into the canal for irrigation, the PWD has launched a drive to remove the weeds as it would impede the water flow. A senior official said water hyacinth from Puthur aqueduct to District Sessions Court has been removed so far. Besides a couple of earth movers, at least a dozen personnel had been engaged.

Special Correspondent,"Expressing concern over the possibility of the spread of the novel corona virus through the biometric authenticated distribution of essential commodities ration shops, introduced as a pilot project in Tiruchi and neighbouring districts, a section of activists in the city have urged the district authorities to suspend its implementation temporarily. Tiruchi district is one of the three districts in the State, which has been chosen to implement the new system on a pilot basis. Ariyalur and Perambalur are the other two districts implementing the system in the State. Under the system, the Food and Civil Supplies Department has established Aadhaar enabled biometric devices in all ration shops in three districts to scan and verify the fingerprints of card holders before distributing rations at points of sale. In Tiruchi district, the Food and Civil Supplies Department has already begun the system of distributing rations in Mannachanallur, Tiruchi (West) and Tiruchi (East) taluks. Though the new system, aimed at checking the malpractices and distribution of subsidised commodities to those in possession of fake ration cards, is largely welcomed by the people, the timing of implementation has received widespread criticism. Under the system, the cardholders have to place their fingerprints on biometric device to prove their authenticity to draw rations. But, it is said that there are practical difficulties in implementing the system at the time of the pandemic. Many cardholders, who visit the fair price shops, are poor and do not make use of sanitisers during the process of biometric authentication. Consumer activists are apprehensive that the physical verification of fingerprints on the device would give room for the spread of virus. However, a senior official of the Department of Cooperation said that hand sanitizers have been provided at all 1,224 fair price shops in the district. The sales personnel have been given clear instruction to ensure that all card holders cleaned their hands using the sanitizers before the affixing their fingerprint on the devices. Physical distancing and wearing of face masks have also been made compulsory. Hence, chances of the infection spreading from the rations shops were remote, he maintained. But consumers are not convinced. M. Sekaran, president, Federation of Consumer and Service Organisations, who visited a fair price shop at Ariyamangalam in the city, alleged that many consumers failed to use hand sanitisers while buying rations. Each shop had an average of 1,000 family cards. It was difficult to ensure virus protection norms when many consumers turned up on the day of distribution of important commodities. Mr. Sekaran claimed that a few States particularly Kerala had deferred the system due to COVID-19. There should be no urgency in implementing the system. The State government should postpone the project until COVID-19 situation was improved, he said. “The new system may be good to regulate the distribution. But, the timing of its launch is not right. Chances of people getting infection can not be ruled out when they place their fingers on the devices,” said Ghouse Baig, a consumer activist in Tiruchi, after visiting a fair price shop at Edamalaipattipudur.",2020-08-09,TH32307961,TIRUCHI,‘Suspend implementation of biometric system at ration shops,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/suspend-implementation-of-biometric-system-at-ration-shops/article32307961.ece

P.A. Narayani,"Several stone tools and artefacts belonging to microlithic age and iron age were found at the foothills of the Western Ghats in Manuthu - Paraipatti village near Usilampatti block in Madurai by K.T. Gandhirajan, an art historian who undertakes documentation of historical monuments across the State, along with a group of enthusiasts. Mr. Gandhirajan said that around 20 cup marks were found on a rock shelter found at the site. “Cup marks is a prehistoric art form that is found on rocks across the world. Though there are different interpretations regarding the cup marks, there is no specific meaning that can be derived out of them,” he says. The rock shelter, which is huge, can accommodate around 20 people and could have been used by hunters-gatherers during that period, he adds. Several stones belonging to microlithic age, dating back to around 3,000 to 5,000 years, were found near the rock shelter. These stones were of different colours, sizes and shapes. “These stones could have been used to tear down the hunted animals for consumption of meat,” he says. Remains belonging to the iron age, including iron slags and moulds, were also found. “By the iron-age period, the people engaged in agriculture-related activities too,” he says. Burial urns were also found there. “By these remains we can infer that people belonging to different time periods and cultures settled down at this site. This region’s landscape was Mullai (forest) and these remains show the kind of civilisations that have evolved in the foothills,” he says. This place, which was an old trade route leading towards Chera kingdom, has high potential for further archaeological excavation, he adds.",2020-08-09,TH32307706,Madurai,Artefacts from microlithic and iron age found,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/artefacts-from-microlithic-and-iron-age-found/article32307706.ece

Special Correspondent,"After giving a three-month breather to registered societies to conduct annual general body meeting, the State Government has once again come to the rescue of the societies; this time to the defunct societies though. Earlier, in an order, the Government had extended by three months the time period for registered societies to conduct annual general body in view of extraordinary circumstances prevailing due to COVID-19 pandemic. It had also said that the societies now had time till December end to conduct the meeting. In another order related to the societies, the Government had said that the defunct societies could now approach the registrar of the district concerned if the period of condonation was less than 10 years and the Inspector General of Registration if it was 10 to 20 years and the Government for period over 20 years. The latest order enhances the power of the district registrar by seven years – from three to 10, and the Inspector General of Registration by 15 years from five to 20 years. The move was aimed at helping defunct societies get their act together to revive the society at the district level. Welcoming the move, consumer activist K. Kathirmathiyon said this would help defunct societies renew their membership and thereby make use of their immovable assets and operate bank accounts. The Government had, however, disallowed the demand for holding virtual annual general body meeting.

And some are seen walking without a mask. On Saturday, many shops on Wallers Road had a few customers standing close to each other. The average size of most shops here are between 100 sq.ft-300 sq ft. “Today being a Saturday the footfall is high and we can’t afford to wait until each person gets a temperature check. We will lose the customer to a nearby shop,” said a shop owner. A few shops on Ritchie Street are also not following the guidelines given by the association. When the market re-opened, the associations had clearly said that only alternate shops should be kept open. All shops were marked with a red and green label with numbers 1 and 2 printed on them for this purpose. But in the last few days and specifically on Saturday, shops with red and green labels were kept open in many roads. Another shop owner here, who had a red label pasted on his outlet, said, “Opening shops on alternate days is really not helping us. We need to pay rent and salaries. If we close down for one day it means a huge loss,” he said. A shop onwer on Narasingapuram Street said traders from Burma Bazaar and other zones were allowed to sell their products here (like a shop-in-shop). R. Chandalia, secretary, Chennai Electronics and Infotech Traders Association, said he had not received any complaint so far and safety measures were being taken. Mukesh Khubchandani, president of All India Electronics Association, Chennai, said: “From time to time, we visit the shops.”",2020-08-09,TH32307685,CHENNAI,Ritchie Street shops flout all norms,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ritchie-street-shops-flout-all-norms/article32307685.ece
B. Kolappan,"Reduced to rubble in 1800, the fort of the Marudu Brothers at Aranmanai Siruvayal in Sivaganga district, a symbol of resistance to the British, is gradually rising like as a phoenix. The Archaeology Department of the State government has undertaken the restoration work at a cost of Rs. 60.13 lakh. “The funding has come from the Asian Development Bank (ADB),” said Ma Foi K. Pandiarajan, Minister for Tamil Development and Culture. The Archaeology Department is using lime and sand paste for the restoration works. Workers from Kovilpatti and surrounding areas who have expertise in restoration work are employed. “We are erecting a strong fencing normally designed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI),” he said. The fort and the village fell into the hands of the British on July 30, 1800. “The fine extensive village of Sherewele (Siruvayal), almost destroyed by the flames, which had spread with great fury, accelerated by a high wind, fell into our hands without opposition, although every house was capable of a sturdy defence, and it had a very thick hedge all around it,” Colonel James Welsh, a friend-turned-foe of the Marudu Brothers, had said in his book . Welsh maintained a good relationship with Periya Marudu and Chinna Marudu, but fell out with them after they refused to hand over Oomaithurai, the brother of Kattabomman. His reminiscences of the two brothers offer good insights into their characters. The elder brother was called Wella, or Vellu Murdoo, but he had nothing to do with the management of the country. “He was a great sportsman and gave up his whole time to hunting and shooting. Being a man of uncommon stature and strength, it was even said that he could bend a common Arcot rupee with his fingers,” Welsh had written. Writing about Chinna Marudu, Welsh says, “Though of a dark complexion, he was a portly, handsome, and affable man, of the kindest manners, and most easy access; and though ruling over a people to whom his very nod was a law, he lived in an open Palace, without a single guard.” “Yet this very man, I was afterwards destined by the fortune of war, to chase like a wild beast; to see badly wounded, and captured by common peons; then lingering with a fractured thigh in prison, and lastly, to behold him, with his gallant brother, and no less gallant son, surrounded by their principal adherents, hanging in chains upon a common gibbet,” Welsh had recorded. They were subsequently hanged in Tirupattur.",2020-08-09,TH32307724,CHENNAI,"Fort of Marudu Brothers, a symbol of resistance, re-emerges",https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fort-of-marudu-brothers-a-symbol-of-resistance-re-emerges/article32307724.ece
Special Correspondent,"The Guindy police have arrested a 32-year-old woman, working as a food delivery agent, on charges of delivering ganja to customers across the city, over the past few months.

During an inquiry, she reportedly told the police that she had started delivering ganja recently. “Her service used to be sought by a woman in Koyambedu regularly.

Serena Josephine M.,"The data on the number of doctors who have died of COVID-19 has sparked a political controversy in Tamil Nadu, with two wings of the Indian Medical Association releasing different sets of figures. The Indian Medical Association (headquarters) made an official statement on August 7 that 43 doctors had died of COVID in Tamil Nadu. Both Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar and the State IMA president had rejected the quoted figure earlier this week, after the DMK’s Udhayanidhi Stalin tweeted the data set. The IMA’s data on State-wise doctors’ deaths was widely circulated on social media earlier this week. In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, IMA (headquarters) disclosed the details of 196 doctors who had died of COVID-19 in the country. The IMA’s submissions included a document containing the deceased doctors’ details like name, age, IMA branch and speciality. Forty-three of them were from T.N. — the highest figure in the country. “The entire data is from within IMA. The details were verified by another IMA member or by local branches. We have published authentic data. When we released only the numbers, it was subjected to varied interpretations. We have now released the names of the doctors. The State can investigate the details and find out whether the deaths were COVID-19 or non-COVID [deaths]. Our concern is that so many doctors have died,” said R.V. Asokan, honorary secretary-general, IMA (HQs). K. Senthil, president of the Tamil Nadu Government Doctors’ Association, said two government doctors had died of COVID-19 in T.N., while C.N. Raja, president of IMA-Tamil Nadu, said that as per their list, 20 private practitioners had died of COVID-19. Hence, 22 doctors had succumbed to the infection in all. Dr. Raja said, “The data that 43 doctors have died is wrong. As soon as we received it, we started to cross-verify the list. We are investigating the deaths, and there seems to be non-COVID deaths too. We have asked all IMA branches to check and get supporting documents,” he said. In the midst of all this, doctors have begun to question if the State government has any data on doctors’ deaths at all. When the data was sought, an official said he would collect the details and then provide them. However, a group of doctors have been collecting details from various doctors’ groups and from Facebook since the start of the pandemic. “From March till date, 27 doctors have died of COVID-19 in Tamil Nadu. They include two government doctors — Kalyanaraman of Thoothukudi and Sugumaran, chief medical officer of Madurantakam GH. Fourteen other doctors, including five in the government sector, have died of other reasons during the pandemic,” said a doctor, on the condition of anonymity. A majority of those who died of COVID were aged between 40 and 60, and a few above 60. The Health Minister could not be reached for comment. A senior health official said data released by IMA was not related to the government. DMK president M.K. Stalin urged the Health Minister to disclose the number of doctors who had died of COVID-19 in T.N. In a tweet, he referred to the data released by IMA. “Hiding deaths is not the way to prevent deaths,” he said.",2020-08-09,TH32307719,CHENNAI,Death data released by IMA contradicts Minister’s statement,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/death-data-released-by-ima-contradicts-ministers-statement/article32307719.ece
Mohamed Imranullah S.,"The Madras High Court on Friday impressed upon the need for the State government to “seriously” look into scores of complaints regarding government officials making illegal money, even during a grave situation posed by the pandemic, by collecting bribe for issuing e-passes to people for travelling from one district to another. Justices N. Kirubakaran and V.M. Velumani said: “For the past few months, people have been unable to work or travel from one place to another for various purposes and they have been put to untold misery. Though the government is not responsible for the present position, some corrupt officials involved in issuing e-passes are bent upon making a booty.” “It is very shocking to know about such incidents and also about cut-throat corrupt officials in the system. They are like cruel bloodthirsty wolves and they should be dealt with an iron hand. Throughout the State, there are allegations that there are brokers available for getting e-passes, and the rate ranges between Rs. 500 and Rs. 2,000,” the judges noted. The observations were made while passing orders on a habeas corpus petition filed by C.M. Sivababu, president of the Tamil Desiya Makkal Katchi, to produce six adolescent boys and girls who were reportedly detained against their wishes in a private spinning mill in Tiruppur. Taking serious note, the court had directed the police to act. Accordingly, the Superintendent of Police reported to the court that a raid conducted in the mill on Thursday did not lead to any findings on employment of child labour. However, it was found that the mill had employed 331 people, of whom 133 were aged between 14 and 18, brought from various districts, and most of them were from Tiruvannamalai. The chairperson of the Tiruppur district welfare board told the court that only on July 28, the Labour Department officials had conducted a raid and found 95 workers, including 42 adolescents and two children. Since many adolescent workers complained about low wages, they were rescued and sent back to their native districts. When the judges interacted with some of the adolescent children through videoconferencing on Friday, they did not complain about the working conditions but appeared to have been tutored. “This is a classic case demonstrating how corrupt government servants utilise any situation to make illegal gains,” the judges said, and directed the mill management to explain, by August 20, how it managed to transport so many people from one district to another during a pandemic.",2020-08-09,TH32307713,CHENNAI,"Take serious note of complaints regarding corruption in issuance of e-passes, HC tells T.N. govt",https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/take-serious-note-of-complaints-regarding-corruption-in-issuance-of-e-passes-hc-tells-tn-govt/article32307713.ece
Staff Reporter,"The pandemic and its gendered impact took centre stage at a virtual discussion organised by the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation on Saturday, as experts deconstructed the effect COVID-19 has had on women’s work, nutrition security, reproductive health and education, and gender-based violence. “Pandemics, outbreaks and emergencies, in general, have differential impacts on women and men, and experiences depend on biological and gender characteristics as well as their interaction with other social determinants. Both global and national plans for COVID-19 preparedness and response need to be grounded on a strong gender analysis,” said Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist, World Health Organisation (WHO). Since there was only a limited availability of disaggregated data based on sex and age, she urged the States affected by COVID-19 to collect, report and analyse data based on these and other factors. “A gender analysis of the data can be undertaken and States should invest in quality gender-responsive research on the differential impacts of COVID-19 on men and women,” she added. Highlighting the impact of COVID-19 on women’s work, food and nutrition security, Nitya Rao, professor, University of East Anglia, U.K., spoke about how a large number of women in the informal sector were among the first to be affected when the pandemic struck. “It is necessary to address the devaluation of women’s work as well as all forms of structural violence, that is central to their dignity, equality and justice,” she said. Poonam Muttreja, executive director, Population Foundation of India, stressed the need to provide uninterrupted reproductive and maternal healthcare services. “Studies from across the globe indicate how a lack of investment in family planning is impacting public health measures. Capacity building of women front-line workers, who are large in numbers and are often the only points of contact for women in remote places, should be done, and counselling services should be strengthened,” she said. Stating that gender-based violence would get exacerbated as the pandemic goes on, she said that it was imperative to have a response to this factored into the public health system in the country. Highlighting the increase in the care burden for women, Dr. Kezevino Aram, president, Shanti Ashram, Coimbatore, said that women have had to take up multiple roles that they were previously sharing with other individuals or support services. She stressed on the need for protective measures in the informal sector so that women were not exploited. “From a community point of view, I feel that never before has it been so important for public health interventions to look at decentralised governance as an important medium of building composite responses to the pandemic,” she added. Avni Amin, scientist, Gender Team, Department of Reproductive Health and Research, WHO, spoke about the global gender impact of COVID-19. Among the critical interventions necessary to address the concerns surrounding children affected by the closure of schools and anganwadi centres, is a cluster-mapping exercise, said Anjana Mangalagiri, senior fellow, Institute of Social Sciences. This must be undertaken in each block to update data on children below the age of six, she said. “The rights and needs of children have been largely ignored through the crisis and if there is no focus on their growth and development, this will be a humanitarian crisis in the making,” she added.

Special Correspondent,"The Greater Chennai Corporation will approve 30% more e-pass for entry of persons from other parts of the country, owing to introduction of two additional categories for issuance of e-passes. At present, the civic body has approved just 33% of the applications for e-pass to visit the city, rejecting more than three lakh applications. The civic body had been issuing e-pass only for three categories — marriage, death and medical emergency. Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash on Saturday said people who seek e-pass for “work-related” travel to Chennai will get it. “Anyone who wants to appear for an interview will get e-pass for visiting Chennai. Persons who want to sign a business agreement may apply for an e-pass,” said Mr. Prakash. Guest workers from other States will be permitted under a different category, with facilities for 14-day quarantine by the employer. “At least 1.4 lakh guest workers left the city by train free of cost. We spent Rs. 18 crore to send them home. They have started returning to Chennai. We will approve e-pass for such persons,” said Mr. Prakash. Stressing the need for COVID-19 containment activities for at least another three months, Mr. Prakash said the case positivity rate was 8.5% in the city and was expected to fall 6% by the end of August. “The case fatality rate is 2.12%. Our target is to reduce it to 1.5%. The case doubling rate is 72.2 days. It was 64 days last week. Many zones of north Chennai have registered a case doubling rate of 140 days,” said Mr. Prakash.

Special Correspondent,"DMK president M.K. Stalin has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal, urging them to halt the implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 until the situation is conducive to follow due process enshrined in the Constitution. “At the outset, while the country is reeling from the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and the economy is stagnating, the unilateral decision to approve the NEP 2020 without discussion or deliberation in Parliament undermines the foundational principles of our democracy,” he said in the letter. Today, the unilateral move by the Central government to have a larger say on education policy has serious repercussions on the idea of federalism, which is the mainstay of the Indian union, Mr. Stalin said. “When the draft of the policy was given for public scrutiny in 2019, the DMK had strongly opposed various provisions and submitted suggestions to the Centre. However, the NEP that has been approved is no way different to its previous draft in 2019 with none of the recommendations incorporated,” he added. Mr. Stalin pointed out that the proposed policy threatens the progress made in educational attainment, access and quality in the country by undermining not just the authority of States but also setting up additional barriers to social justice and equity in the country. “The one-size-fits-all approach in this policy create unnecessary additional barriers for students from all parts of the country and all backgrounds to access education,” he added. Mr. Stalin pointed out that the two-language formula with compulsory Tamil learning has already been implemented and progressed well in Tamil Nadu and the three-language formula proposed in the education policy with a compulsory option of Sanskrit at all levels of education, including higher education, cannot be accepted. “This move undermines the glory and dignity of Tamil language and is an affront to the feelings of the people of Tamil Nadu,” he said. The National Education Policy has stated that it wants to reduce the burden of learning on students and parents, but the assessment for class 3, 5 and 8 seems antithetical to that notion, Mr. Stalin said. He also flayed the move of standardised entrance examinations for college admissions and said this discriminates against students from marginalised groups. The education policy has not mentioned anything about the reservations for socially backward communities and has fewer provisions for increasing the female enrolment ratio in schools and in the higher education system, he added.",2020-08-09,TH32307721,CHENNAI,Stalin urges PM to halt NEP implementation,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stalin-urges-pm-to-halt-nep-implementation/article32307721.ece

JAGRITI CHANDRA,"Several recommendations made for the Calicut airport in 2011 by an air safety committee constituted in the aftermath of the Mangaluru crash were implemented, while a few could not be executed due to the lack of land availability, said the chief of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), Arun Kumar, in an interview on Saturday. “The safety area on both sides of the runway was increased, and some other measures were also adopted. These were implemented in several batches until 2017. However, the length of the runway could not be increased because of land availability issues,” the DGCA chief said. The DGCA is the aviation safety regulatory body of the country. Mr. Kumar said the length of the two runways at the Calicut airport is 8,000 feet, which he claimed is adequate for wide-bodied and narrow-bodied planes. Friday’s ill-fated aircraft was the narrow-bodied Boeing 737. A separate audit of the airport done in 2019, following multiple runway excursions in rainy conditions, also led to Mr. Kumar making stringent observations, as many as 16, against Calicut International Airport. These included concerns about “excessive rubber deposits”, “water stagnation”, and “several cracks”. “These actions were acted upon. AAI procured a rubber removal equipment machine and did periodic friction tests as well. Several actions were taken, including against errant officials. We were satisfied with compliance,” Mr. Kumar said. He also told that the aircraft touched down in the second attempt, after aborting landing in the first instance — an indication of adverse conditions making the landing tough. Pilots are encouraged to abort landings if they have apprehensions. He said that the aircraft landed beyond the touchdown zone of zero feet to 3,000 feet, increasing the chances of overshooting the runway, and stopped 10 feet beyond the runway safety area. Mr. Kumar said he will not speculate about the cause of the accident. “Only the flight data recorder and the voice data recorder (two black boxes) will reveal the cause. Anything could have gone wrong — adverse wind conditions or some technical malfunction,” he said. A team of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau — the agency in-charge of probing accidents — arrived at the accident site on Saturday morning. The team will seek help from Boeing, as well as their U.S. counterpart, the National Transport Safety Board, for downloading the data and analysing it. This is likely to take “a day or two”.",2020-08-09,TH32307546,NEW DELHI,Several safety steps implemented: DGCA chief,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/several-safety-steps-implemented-dgca-chief/article32307546.ece

The heavy flood is expected to improve the water storage in Srisailam considerably as the Central Water Commission has forecast that it is likely to receive a flood of about 8.4 tmc ft in 12 hours from 6 pm on Saturday to 6 am on Sunday as the inflows are set to go up to over 1.94 lakh cusecs.

A Correspondent,"With a considerable increase in the water level in the Mullaperiyar dam, Kerala has asked Tamil Nadu to initiate urgent measures to keep the storage in the dam at a manageable level. The water level in the dam reached 134.85 ft at 10 p.m. on Saturday, an unprecedented increase of over 10 ft in two days. The maximum level of the dam is 142 ft. There was an inflow of 8,143 cumecs while the discharge was 167 cumecs. In the event of the water level touching 136 ft, Tamil Nadu should draw water from Mullaperiyar to the Vaigai dam. Chief Secretary Vishwas Mehta has written to his Tamil Nadu counterpart K. Shanmugam in this regard, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in Thiruvananthapuram on Saturday. Kerala should be warned at least 24 hours before the spillway shutters are raised, the letter said. The water level in the Mullaperiyar dam which stood at 116.20 ft on August 3 shot up to 131.25 ft at 2 p.m on Friday. The dam recorded a rainfall of 198.4 mm for the past 24 hours, Mr. Mehta said adding that immediate steps should be taken to release water in phases. The details of the water level in the dam and the water flow should be handed over to and discussed with Kerala. There was heavy rainfall in the State, especially in Idukki, leading to a heavy inflow of water into the dam, he said. A flash flood on Thursday night inundated Vandiperiyar, Karinkulam Chappathu, and Upputhara towns downstream of the dam destroying the Santhipalam bridge and damaging the Kartinkulam Chappathu bridge. Though the water receded in the morning on Friday, the continuing rain was a cause of concern for the people. In the August 2018 flood, downstream areas of the dam suffered heavy damage after the dam was opened leading to release of water from the Idukki reservoir downstream. As the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has put Idukki on red alert on Sunday also, the administration has taken steps to open relief camps in case of an emergency. The shutters of the Poringalkuthu dam have been opened with the water level rising in the Chalakudy basin. Kerala has also requested Tamil Nadu to ensure interaction between Kerala and Tamil Nadu engineers when water is discharged from the dams in the Parambikulam-Aliyar Project (PAP) system.

Six BJP legislators left Jaipur by a chartered flight for Gujarat’s Porbandar on Saturday, while 12 others left for Ahmedabad on Friday. From Porbandar, the MLAs were reportedly taken to Somnath where they will be staying at a hotel booked by the Gujarat BJP. Those who left for Porbandar were Nirmal Kumawat, Gopi Chand Meena, Jabbar Singh Sankhla, Dharmendra Kumar, Gopal Lal Sharma and Gurdeep Singh. The action for sequestering MLAs was launched after former Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Vasundhara Raje met party president J.P. Nadda, general secretary B.L. Santhosh and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in New Delhi to discuss the political situation in the State. Ms. Raje had maintained silence over the political turmoil and kept away from the party meetings in Jaipur.

Notable changes figuring in the list issued on Friday include Patanjali Jha, who has been shifted from Bengaluru where he was Director General (Investigation) to CCIT-II in Mumbai. Another noticeable change is that of Amit Jain, who was transferred from Gujarat to Mumbai only recently but has been moved back to Gujarat in less than two months, even without his taking charge in Mumbai. The changes brought by the CBDT have apparently flummoxed Revenue Service officials by the way appointments and transfer orders at the top level are happening in the Finance Ministry’s Revenue wing. Sources said it could also be causing a sense of resentment among the senior officials who feel that, on the one hand, there are vacancies in the CBDT as well as at the PCCIT level in several places, and on the other, certain officials are not only given extension in deviation of the established norms but also given multiple charges despite the availability of top-ranking officials. The post of PCCIT Mumbai has not been filled and is continued to be held on in-charge basis by S.K.

Legal Correspondent,"The Supreme Court has sought an explanation from its Registry officials involved in the listing of a writ petition filed jointly by veteran journalists N. Ram and Arun Shourie, along with advocate Prashant Bhushan, challenging a law that makes “scandalising of court” a ground for contempt. A short note from an official source in the court said a ‘mistake’ had been made by the Registry in the listing of the case. The writ petition was listed for hearing before a Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and K.M. Joseph on August 10. The court website now shows the petition has been dropped from the list of cases before that Bench on that day. The note explained that the petition, as per established procedure, should have been listed before the Bench which was already seized of a “similar matter”. A three-judge Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra had recently initiated and heard a contempt case against Mr. Bhushan for “scandalising the court” with his tweet featuring a photograph of Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde on a heavy motorbike and another about the role of the court in the past six years. The Justice Mishra Bench has reserved the case for orders. The present writ petition is accompanied by an application for stay of all contempt proceedings initiated on the ground of “scandalising the court”, which includes the proceedings before the Justice Mishra Bench. The writ petition has challenged the legality of Section 2(c)(i) of the Contempt of Court Act, which deals with contempt on the ground of scandalising the court and the “chilling effect” it has on free speech and right to dissent. Section 2(c) (i) holds it is criminal contempt if a person publishes, by words spoken or written or by any other act, anything “which scandalises or tends to scandalise or lowers or tends to lower the authority of any court”. “‘Scandalising the court’ is rooted in colonial assumption and objects, which has no place in legal orders committed to democratic constitutionality and maintenance of an open robust public sphere,” the writ petition said.",2020-08-09,TH32307563,NEW DELHI,SC asks Registry to explain case listing,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-asks-registry-to-explain-case-listing/article32307563.ece
Jagriti Chandra,"Air India Express lost two of its pilots in Friday’s crash, Captain Deepak Vasant Sathe and First Officer Akhilesh Kumar. Captain Deepak Vasant Sathe, 59, Commander of the ill-fated flight, was a highly decorated pilot. He received the Sword of Honour at the Air Force Academy given to the top-ranking cadet, and was an accomplished fighter pilot. He was also a test pilot for Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. He joined Air India Express in 2013, and had earlier served Air India. An airline colleague remembered him for his “officer-like gentlemanliness”. “He was very approachable and many junior pilots looked up to him because he often counselled and mentored them. He was an asset to the airline and a humble person despite his long career as a pilot,” a senior pilot said. The Indian Air Force colleagues were also devastated by the death. “My association with him started at Air Force Station, Bidar, earlier called Elementary Flying School. We were commissioned as pilot officers in 1981. He was best in our course, extremely good, hard working and knowledgeable. As a fighter pilot, he flew MiG-21,” Air Commodore (Retd.) Ashit Mehta said. He said Sathe, who took voluntary retirement as Wing Commander, was an experimental test pilot — a demanding job that requires testing planes. Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Puri said the Captain had flown 27 times to the Calicut airport. First Officer Akhilesh Kumar, 32, was very familiar with the airport and its ‘critical’ status. His home base was Kozhikode.",2020-08-09,TH32307552,NEW DELHI,Sathe was a decorated pilot,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sathe-was-a-decorated-pilot/article32307552.ece
Special Correspondent,"With over 200 COVID-19 vaccine candidates in development and 27 of them on clinical trials across the world, Chief Scientist at the World Health Organisation (WHO) Soumya Swaminathan raised the need to have a multilateral or global approach to vaccine deployment and distribution, rather than a more nationalistic approach. Noting that the term “vaccine nationalism” was being used to describe the fact that many countries are only thinking about their own population, she said, “The argument we are making is that the virus is everywhere in the world and it would be impossible for the world to go back to normal, and for the economy to recover if only pockets of people are protected...” Dr. Swaminathan was delivering the Lawrence Dana Pinkham Memorial Lecture on “COVID-19 pandemic: What we know and the role of the media” — the commencement lecture for Asian College of Journalism (ACJ) class of 2020-2021 on Saturday. However, she said it was a difficult issue because most political leaders would first think about protecting their own people. “It is true that they have a responsibility. At the same time, in this particular case, it is not enough to protect only their citizens. It is important to ensure that people around the world have access in an equitable way. What we are proposing is, if we have a limited supply of vaccines at the beginning of 2021, lets say a few hundred million doses, how do we distribute that? Who should get it first? All frontline workers, health workers and social care workers, police and others at high risk of getting the infection. Should they not be prioritised before the otherwise healthy adult population,” she stated. Elaborating on this, Dr Swaminathan said there were two options — a few countries vaccinate their entire population, while others wait for a long time. “Today, 10% of all infections have occurred in healthcare workers. It would be unfair not to protect them before everyone else gets a chance,” she said. This was an ongoing dialogue happening globally, and getting a consensus was a challenge, she added. Referring to the WHO’s Solidarity Trial in which 25 countries were participating and over 6,500 patients were recruited, she said this was something that they wanted to promote for vaccines as well. “There are a large number of vaccine candidates in development. Some of them are big companies; multinationals have the resources and expertise to run their own trials, while smaller companies may not get the same opportunities. We want to provide a platform for vaccines to be tested,” she said. Stressing on equitable access, she said, “We have had bad experiences in the past in previous epidemics including the H1N1 pandemic when vaccines were cornered by high income countries, and very little left for low income countries. Only when the pandemic turned out not so serious that those countries, which had stockpiled vaccines, gave up some of their stock for distribution in low income countries. This could be a terrible thing to happen this time around.” More than 4,000 clinical trials were registered with WHO, she said.",2020-08-09,TH32307538,CHENNAI,WHO official warns against ‘vaccine nationalism’,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/who-official-warns-against-vaccine-nationalism/article32307538.ece
Meera Srinivasan,"Days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi telephoned his Sri Lankan counterpart Mahinda Rajapaksa to congratulate him on his party’s big win in the recently held parliamentary polls, the Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Gopal Baglay, called on the newly elected leader in Colombo to congratulate him on the “emphatic victory”. “The strong mandate received by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa provides a fresh opportunity for the two countries to enhance bilateral engagement, including mitigating the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,” the Indian High Commission here said in a statement following the meeting. Mr. Rajapaksa’s ruling party secured a two-thirds majority in Wednesday’s polls. “The High Commissioner reiterated the strong desire and the commitment of the government of India to work very closely with the new government and Parliament in Sri Lanka for further strengthening comprehensive bilateral cooperation. He looked forward to continued guidance from Sri Lanka’s leadership in this endeavour,” the statement said. Mr. Modi’s call and the High Commissioner’s subsequent meeting, on the eve of Mr. Rajapaksa’s swearing-in ceremony, comes amid persisting opposition from trade unions at the Colombo Port to Indian involvement in developing a terminal there.

Priscilla Jebaraj,"Around 11 a.m. last Tuesday, 35-year-old Babu Lal went to a ration shop in the Gujarati town of Amreli and bought 9 kg of wheat and 3.5 kg of rice at subsidised rates, just like crores of other ration-card holders across the country. More unusually, however, his ration card is not registered in Amreli, but more than 400 km away at a shop in the small village of Marol in Rajasthan’s Sirohi district. Mr. Lal is one of the first participants in the One nation, One ration card scheme that the Centre has hyped as the solution to the problems of migrant workers whose ration cards are registered in their home villages, leaving them unable to access subsidised foodgrain in their workplaces, often hundreds of kilometres away. However, while four additional States were integrated into the scheme this month, increasing its coverage to 65 crore beneficiaries, Mr. Lal is among a negligible fraction which has actually been able to make use of it. Food Ministry data show that in July, fewer than 2,000 inter-State transactions were carried out under the scheme, benefiting less than 13,000 people. Just over 31,500 kg of grain were distributed. Since the scheme was launched a year ago, the number of monthly beneficiaries never crossed 5,000 until July. In August, Mr. Lal’s purchase is one of just 257 inter-State transactions in the first week, benefiting almost 1,400 people. “The challenge is that at the receiving end, we must encourage workers to go to the nearest fair price shops and get themselves registered. So that is what now State governments have started doing proactively. It will take time, a month or two,” Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey told on Saturday, adding that intra-State usage has been higher, with the total number of such beneficiaries crossing 1.2 crore since the scheme began. “Now the reverse migration is also happening, they are going back. But still the COVID scenario is not very clear, sometimes lockdown somewhere, factories gearing up gradually. It will take a couple of months before it reaches its peak,” Mr. Pandey said. However, Mr. Pandey says that if workers are returning to the cities with jobs, some may choose to leave the entire ration allocation for their families back home. “It depends whether the person is wanting to draw that ration or not. You cannot force him, you can give him an option, but if he still feels that he would prefer his family to draw his share of ration also back home, and here the employer is giving him something, maybe a free meal at the factory, he may not be interested in taking the ration,” he said. According to the Ministry’s portal, Mr. Lal seems to have taken the option of buying a partial share of his family’s ration allocation in Gujarat, picking up a total of 12.5 kg out of the five member family’s monthly allocation of 25 kg. The remainder may have been left for other family members to buy back home in Marol village. There are still 12 States and Union Territories yet to join the scheme, including Delhi with its large migrant population.

The Depsang Plains along with the Pangong Tso are the two major areas of concern in the ongoing stand-off along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. This is the first Major General-level talks since the stoppage of all established meetings between Colonels, Brigadiers and Major Generals following the violent clash at Galwan on June 15. Military talks since then have been limited to Corps Commander level. As reported by on June 2, there is heavy Chinese presence in the Depsang Plains, at a crucial area called the Bulge, and PLA troops have also been blocking Indian Army patrols from reaching the Patrolling Points (PP) 10 to 13. There has also been build up of tanks and armoured vehicles on the Chinese side very close to the LAC. The Chinese ingress in this area threatens Indian positions at Burtse and Raki Nala well inside Indian territory and further DBO by bringing Chinese troops closer to the 255 km long crucial Darbuk-Skyok-DBO road. Depsang is also close to the Karakoram Pass, overlooking the very strategic Saltoro Ridge and Siachen glacier. Depsang is one of the few places on the LAC where tank manoeuvres are possible. During the 1962 war Chinese troops had occupied Depsang Plains and in 2013 Chinese troops came 19 kms inside and pitched tents resulting in a 21 day standoff.",2020-08-09,TH32307602,NEW DELHI,"India, China Major Generals discuss situation at Depsang",https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-china-major-generals-discuss-situation-at-depsang/article32307602.ece

Giji K. Raman,"With the recovery of eight more bodies, the death toll in the Pettimudy landslip rose to 26 on Saturday. Four (workers quarters) in the Nayamakkad tea estate, near Rajamala, in Munnar were buried under the debris of a major landslip on Thursday night. The search operations, which were discontinued late on Friday due to unfavourable weather, resumed on Saturday morning. Devikulam subcollector S. Premkrishnan said the ground was prepared for burying the bodies near the accident area. After completing the autopsy and other formalities, the bodies would be buried there. It was estimated that 44 people were still missing, he added. Though the weather condition at Pettimudy was favourable in the morning, rain and mist hampered the search operation in the afternoon. An NDRF team was leading the operation, with doctors camping near a makeshift mortuary to conduct post-mortem examination. The search operations will continue on Sunday. So far, 24 bodies have been identified. It is feared that 21 persons from a family are among the victims. Mayilswami, his brother Ganesh, Ananthasivam, and their families were trapped in the accident. Mayilswami was a driver at the Eravikulam National Park. Six persons hit by the landslip were staff of the Forest Department. They are Mayilswami, Ganeshan, Rekha, Raja, Manikandan, and Achutan. The bodies of Raja and Mayilswami had been recovered. The news of the tragedy reached outside only on Friday morning due to the inaccessibility of the area. The residents reached a forest check-post at Rajamala and informed the officials there.

PTI,"To boost ‘self-reliant India’ endeavour, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on August 8 urged the industry to identify the sectors heavily reliant on imports, particularly from China, and look for substitutes towards indigenous production to make India a super power. Asserting that a case study is in the offing based on three years of imports and exports, Mr. Gadkari said China’s 70% of exports pertained to ten sectors that included electrical machinery and equipment accounting for 26.09% of its exports worth $671 billion and machinery including computers grabbing 10.70% of its exports worth $417 billion. Road Transport, Highways and MSME Minister Mr. Gadkari while addressing a CII event “India@75 Summit — Mission 2022” urged the industry to look beyond metropolises and developed cities to lay a network of industries and ventures in rural, far-flung and tribal areas which never grabbed attention. “It pains me that 90% of the focus of industry bodies is on major industries in big cities and metropolises. There is seldom any focus on rural, tribal and remote areas. There is a need to change it... Advance sector wise planning is the need of the hour to make India a super power,” Mr. Gadkari said. “China’s 70% of exports are from 10 sectors,” Mr. Gadkari said and urged CII to identify what was imported in India and how can that be replaced with indigenous production for ‘self-reliance’ while assuring all government support in this initiative. He said of the China’s exports, apart from machinery and equipment, furniture and related things accounted for exports worth $100 billion, plastics products ($84 billion), vehicles (74.40 billion) and clothings ($66.80 billion). “CII should identify sectors to boost exports and reduce imports. In some areas we will have to increase import duty to encourage Indian manufacturers,” he said. Assuring all possible help to the industry for making rural and tribal areas their hub, the minister said a wide network of highways, railways and waterways was bound to bring down logistics cost. He also said that a host of initiatives including redefining the definition of MSMEs will yield rich dividends. The minister informed that the government is working on a scheme for inclusion of smallest units under the MSME ambit and providing for their micro-financial requirements. He also stressed the need for upgradation of technology by industry players and urged them to explore joint ventures to bring in foreign low cost capital. In addition, he urged the industry to come up with the list of obsolete legislations hindering their growth so that steps could be taken to facilitate new ventures besides. “There is an urgent need to create employment, and focussing on rural, agriculture, tribal and village areas including 115 aspirational districts could be beneficial. The target is to shift about 7-8% of population from overcrowded cities to upcoming smart cities and villages,” the Minister said. He exhorted the industry to explore investment opportunities on the sides of proposed 22 new expressways. He also asked the industry body CII to draft a proposal for insurance of highway stretches, saying this will do away the requirement of bank guarantees. “This will speed up financial closure of road projects and finance raising, facilitating faster project completions,” he said. The Minister also said that he was in discussion with Uttarakhand government for developing Auli, a famous tourist destination, into a world-class place so that it becomes a venue for events like the World Economic Forum that takes place in Davos, Switzerland.",2020-08-09,TH32306567,New Delhi,"Nitin Gadkari exhorts industry to identify sectors to boost exports, make India ‘self-reliant’",https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/nitin-gadkari-exhorts-industry-to-identify-sectors-to-boost-exports-make-india-self-reliant/article32306567.ece

PTI,"Demand for small warehouses within city limits is expected to rise over the next one year as e-commerce firms are targeting to ensure same-day deliveries of food and groceries to customers, according to a report. The demand is likely to be for warehousing of 5,000-10,000 sq ft size, property consultant Colliers International said. “E-commerce companies are focussing on same-day delivery with the pandemic-influenced lockdowns placing greater dependency on e-commerce for food and grocery items,” the firm said. The consultant said e-commerce companies are now trying to stock a larger proportion of inventory closer to their customers’ locations for efficiency and to improve the quality of products upon delivery. “Over the next 12 months, we believe in-city warehouses will gain traction, to be used as small distribution hubs. We expect occupiers to scout for in-city warehousing space in the range of 5,000-10,000 sq.ft. in major demand hubs such as Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai and NCR,” the consultant said. Even the older and lesser utilised ground-level office spaces and service centres are being considered to set up small warehouses. Anarock chairman Anuj Puri said e-commerce was flourishing in India even before COVID-19, and lockdowns and closure of malls had accelerated this growth. “In terms of new trends, multi-level warehouses within city limits could see higher demand,” Mr. Puri said. Currently, warehouses in top Indian cities are largely restricted to the peripheries, quite far away from a larger customer base. In-city warehouses will help companies to minimise transportation costs and execute faster delivery timelines, Mr. Puri added.

PTI,"As India’s economic growth begins to pick up, the country is going to need perhaps ‘a little bit of stimulus’ on the demand side, noted economist and former Niti Aayog Vice-Chairman Arvind Panagariya said on Saturday. Mr. Panagariya also said that he was more worried about the general trend of rising import tariffs in India. “Down the road, as the economy is continuing to open up, if we see that inventories are accumulating rapidly then that would be a clear sign that there is a demand deficiency problem. At that point, I think stimulus would be very useful,” he said at CII’s India@75 virtual event. Mr. Panagariya pointed out that even with the current level of intervention, India was staring at debt-to-GDP ratio rising from 72% to about 85% at least by the end of the current year. “And we are going to need perhaps a little bit of stimulus on the demand side as the economy begins to pick up,” the eminent economist said. The Centre in May announced a ₹21 lakh crore stimulus package to help the economy tide over the crisis induced by the coronavirus and subsequent lockdowns. Mr. Panagariya, a professor of economics at Columbia University, said the economy was in stress even before COVID-19 hit it. India’s economy grew at 4.2% in 2019-20. He opined that a large fiscal stimulus in India would not have produced result as it has not given results in the U.S. or Europe. “Large stimulus could help if the supply curve is positively sloped,” he argued. Talking about the government’s ‘Aatmanirbhar’ programme, Mr. Panagariya said Aatmanirbharata (self-reliance) does not require that you got to produce everything that you consume. “Import substitution is not a good idea.. What worried me actually, is turn in the policies that has happened three years ago and trend has not reversed itself,” he said. Mr. Panagariya noted that he does not think that the talk of ‘Aatmanirbharata’ accelerated the process of import substitution policies. “I don’t think since the talk of Aatmanirbharata, this has accelerated...I have heard some talk about import licensing, somebody has told me that import licensing has come back, I have not seen any reports of actual import licences having been imposed,” he said. “Of course that [import licensing] will be complete violation of WTO norms agreement that we have ourselves signed,” he added. Mr. Panagariya also said that he was more worried about the general trend of rising import tariffs in India. He also noted that India is facing a strategic challenge from China because India’s economy is much smaller than China’s.",2020-08-09,TH32306695,New Delhi,Economy may need stimulus on demand side: Niti Aayog Vice-Chairman Arvind Panagariya,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/economy-may-need-stimulus-on-demand-side-niti-aayog-vice-chairman-arvind-panagariya/article32306695.ece
Staff Reporter,"A full-scale drill conducted seven years ago at the Calicut International Airport for assessing its preparedness in meeting emergency situations proved beneficial for a number of emergency medical care technicians, doctors and other first respondents to address the challenge effectively on Friday night. The drill which was organised in 2012 by the Active Network Group of Emergency Life Savers (ANGELS) in association with the Airports Authority of India, Indian Medical Association, the police and fire force departments had managed to identify a number of safety requirements and challenges. Suggestions to address such findings had been submitted to the authorities after the event. ANGELS was then emerging as a trained group of ambulance drivers with competence in handling emergency situations. “It was a big experience as I was then involved in the field-level coordination of the drill in my capacity as ANGELS executive director. The situation was simulated by burning about 5,000 litres of aviation fuel,” said P.P. Venugopal, chief of emergency medicine at Aster MIMS Hospital, which cared for over 40 of the injured passengers on Friday. It was quite distressing that Friday’s crash took place exactly at the same location where the drill was carried out in 2012, he told . The drill had witnessed the participation of a large number of health workers. It was then claimed to be the biggest ever drill conducted at the airport by complying with the guidelines of the Disaster Management Authority. There were also similar drills in later years for auditing safety situations with the participation of airport staff and the Central Industrial Security Force personnel. Dr. Venugopal said the biggest challenge for his medical team on Friday was to manage the critical care needs amid the COVID-19 scare. “There were 150 persons, including doctors, emergency medical technicians and nursing staff wearing PPE kits to handle the situation.

Hence, I hurried out”, he had told his brother-in-law, who is his bystander at the Government General Hospital at Kozhikode Beach. He thanks the seat belt that saved him from being thrown around during the crash. But he is at present fighting a serious blood clot in his internal organs caused by the tightening of the seat belt around his abdomen.  Several survivors of the crash, mostly those with not so serious injuries are under treatment at the Beach Hospital in Kozhikode. Most of them were shifted here from other hospitals on Saturday based on the state of their injury. Mohammed Ali had a good job in Dubai before hit and the firm was shut temporarily.

Special Correspondent,"The flood situation in low-lying areas close to the banks of Periyar and Muvattupuzha rivers eased on Saturday, even as intermittent rain prompted the district administration to continue vigil and shift people from vulnerable locations to safer destinations. Water level in the Muvattupuzha river remained at the danger mark after six shutters of the Malankara dam were raised at 11 a.m. The reading at the gauging station at Kochangadi was 11.51 metres as against the danger level of 10.51 metres in the afternoon. Revenue officials at Muvattupuzha said floodwaters had entered houses at Kacherithazham and Kochangadi. However, it was less severe compared to the levels recorded on Friday. As many as 23 families were shifted to four relief camps, they said. The situation at Kothamangalam improved owing to moderate rainfall till afternoon. Floodwaters that entered houses in Jawahar Colony have started receding, according to Revenue officials. However, over 60 families continue to remain at seven camps opened in the region as a precautionary measure. Meanwhile, water level in the Periyar near the Marthandavarma Bridge in Aluva was 2.3 metres against the 2.5-metre flood warning level, while the corresponding figures near the Mangalapuzha Bridge were 2.55 metres and 3.3 metres respectively. Ernakulam district is expected to receive moderate rainfall for the next two days. District Collector S. Suhas said over 850 persons were staying in 30 relief camps. Water level at the Bhoothathankettu barrage, which was 31 metres on Friday midnight, came down to 28.5 metres on Saturday. “We have issued alerts, especially in coastal areas, in view of the possibility of high tide and strong waves,” he said.

AP,"Just when it looked like Lionel Messi had nowhere to go, the Argentine great bamboozled half of Napoli’s team before scoring from an exquisite solo effort that helped Barcelona reach the Champions League quarterfinals in Portugal. Messi netted Barcelona’s second goal in the 3-1 victory that sent the Spanish side past Napoli on a 4-2 aggregate score on Saturday. Messi’s goal in the 23rd minute was arguably the pick of the 31 he has scored this season in all competitions. Napoli appeared to have him in check when Messi received the ball all alone outside the right corner of the area. Barcelona’s all-time record scorer, however, dipped his head and took on the well-placed defence. He kept control of the ball despite being knocked over while going past three Napoli players. Three more tried to intervene but Messi found the angle to fire while losing his balance to send the ball past the goalkeeper and inside the far post. Clement Lenglet and Luis Suŕrez also scored for Barcelona which advanced five months after it drew 1-1 in Naples before the pandemic stopped European soccer. Barcelona will meet Bayern Munich on Friday in the quarterfinals to be played in Lisbon in a “bubble” format of tight security to prevent a coronavirus outbreak from derailing the competition’s finale. Bayern sealed its spot after beating Chelsea 4-1 with two goals from Robert Lewandowski to complete a 7-1 rout over two legs. ""We are more than satisfied with our first half,” Suŕrez said. “Bayern is a great rival and is one of the favorites, along with us, of the eight that will be in Portugal.” Messi’s beautiful goal doubled Barcelona’s lead after Lenglet headed in a corner in the 10th. The opener settled Barcelona down after Napoli’s Dries Mertens had given the hosts a scare by hitting the post shortly after kickoff. Video review had a busy night. It disallowed another Messi goal for a handball by the forward and then awarded Messi a penalty after he slipped in front of Kalidou Koulibaly and was kicked in the lower left leg by the defender. Messi spent several minutes receiving medical attention, and Suŕrez stepped up to convert the spot kick. Lorenzo Insigne pulled one back for the visitors in first-half injury time with a penalty awarded after Ivan Rakitic fouled Mertens. Gennaro Gattuso’s side came out from halftime on the attack, and in need of two goals to go through. Barcelona’s defence held up and, once the Rakitic-led midfield got control of play, Quique Setişn had time to give a debut to youth player Ramūn Rodrţguez. Barcelona is searching for its first European Cup since 2015 and only a Champions League trophy will prevent it from ending the season without a title for the first time since 2014. It lost the Spanish league title to Real Madrid last month and failed to reach the Copa del Rey final. The comfortable win comes with Setişn under fire from fans after Barcelona’s disappointing finish in the league, coming second to Madrid. There was speculation in Spanish media that his future hinged on beating Napoli. After champion Liverpool, Madrid, and Juventus all exited in the round of 16, Barcelona will believe it has an even better chance to win a sixth title. The match at Camp Nou was played without spectators. Barcelona and large areas of northeast Spain are seeing a recent spike in cases of COVID-19, but health officials assured UEFA the game was safe to play despite the concerns of Napoli. A moment of silence was held for the victims of the pandemic before kickoff.",2020-08-09,TH32307682,BARCELONA,Lionel Messi unstoppable as Barcelona beats Napoli to reach Champions League last 8,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/lionel-messi-unstoppable-as-barcelona-beats-napoli-to-reach-champions-league-last-8/article32307682.ece
K.A. Martin,"The Cochin International Airport (CIAL) authorities are breathing easier this year when compared to August 2018 and 2019, with half of the 26 projects, costing more than ₹129 crore, to prevent flooding of the airport facilities and four neighbouring panchayats being completed. “We passed last week a crucial test on the ability of the newly commissioned projects to help prevent flooding,” airport sources said on Saturday, pointing out that as many as 13 completed projects had kept the airport and neighbouring panchayats dry, even though the water level in the Periyar went up to 7.5 metres above sea level by 9 p.m. on Thursday as measured at the Central Water Commission facility at Neeleeswaram. Seven metres is a flood-like situation as was experienced by Nedumbassery and neighbouring panchayats in 2019. The water level had gone up to 12 metres in 2018, airport sources said on Saturday. While the first phase of the August rain has boosted the confidence of the CIAL authorities, they are keeping their fingers crossed for the remaining part of the season. Heavy flooding of its facilities in 2018 had resulted in the airport being shut down for 15 days, causing a loss of around ₹160 crore. The airport was shut again for around 50 hours in August last year owing to flooding. The projects being undertaken include development of infrastructure in the neighbouring panchayats and measures to ensure that the panchayats do not get isolated due to flooding in the future. Two key bridges, diversion of Chengalthode and its widening, declogging several stretches of storm water passages, demolition of old structures that prevent free flow of water are some of the initiatives. The key component is the work on widening Chengalthodu on the northern side of the runway and the diversion of the canal on the southern side.

Staff Reporter,"Citing dues worth nearly ₹100 crore, the Cochin Corporation Contractor’s Association will go on an indefinite strike from Monday, halting work undertaken by the civic administration. Payments for completed work have not been made to contractors for the past 35 months, from September 2017 onwards, said a statement issued by the association. Repeated entreaties to the corporation and the State government to release their dues have gone in vain, and most contractors are left with little finances of their own to continue work, the statement added. The government owes around ₹30 crore to contractors for work taken up under the Plan Fund. “Contractors have not been able to bear the burden of paying for material and equipment, as well as handing out salaries to workers. Some bills from cleaning of drains and canals from 2018 onwards have not even been prepared,” said K.A. David, secretary of the association. “Going by our agreements with the corporation, payments are to be made within three months of completing the work, which is laughable considering the pending bills now,” he added. The association squarely blamed the corporation’s five-year-long inefficiency for their plight. Work on widening some canals, besides laying slabs and some road and walkway work, will now be halted, Mr. David said. The corporation was set to take a loan and pay contractors ₹10 crore a few months ago, but the government’s sanction for the loan is still pending, said Deputy Mayor K.R. Premakumar. The association had withdrawn another strike in December last year when the ₹10 crore worth of dues was promised to them. “The pending bills that have been prepared amount to only ₹41 crore. Bills for some work might not have been prepared yet. In May this year, the corporation had paid ₹4.2 crore worth of bills from August 2017 to contractors. Attempts will be made to pay some dues now.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central) Sanjay Bhatia said that the accused has been identified as Subash Chander, a resident of Ghaziabad’s Loni. On July 23, one Rajat Kumar, a resident of Loni, approached the police and stated that he works with a food delivering application. He said that after delivering food at Pandav Nagar, he was returning on his bike via Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg. When he reached near Aam Aadmi Party office, a person wearing a police uniform, sitting in an auto, stopped him. “The accused threatened him of challan for rash and negligent driving and asked ₹8,000 as fine,” Mr. Bhatia said, adding that Kumar did not have cash, following which the accused forced him to sit in the auto and asked to withdraw money from an ATM. He also threatened that if the fine was not paid, he would be implicated in a case. The police said that the two went to Connaught Place and the accused sent Kumar to an ATM to withdraw money. “Finding an opportunity, the victim fled and reached DDU Marg where his bike was parked. However, his phone was taken by the accused,” the officer said. After a case was registered and investigation was taken up, the police analysed the CCTV cameras, identified and arrested Chander. During interrogation, the police said, it was revealed that Chander used to work in Delhi Transport Department and was dismissed in 2005 on corruption charges. After being dismissed, he did not have work and started extorting or cheating people either in the name of Delhi Transport or police He has committed several such incidents in the area.

Hemani Bhandari,"There is an unwritten code of conduct among the sex workers at the Swami Shradhanand Marg, the city’s age-old red light area, where business has slowly resumed. Only regular clients are entertained; they need to wash their body with sanitisers and they should wear masks and gloves. Sitting on a narrow stairway are Guddi and Kajal. Their lipstick and kohl are markedly visible, as is a mask around their neck. They are ready, but the business is grim. “For the last few weeks, we have been getting ready but there is hardly any guest. One in a day or two; that too, not a regular occurrence,” complained Guddi, as Kajal went to the window facing the main road. “ [We’ve started standing at the window only a few days ago]”, she chimes in. At this moment, a lean youth wearing mask and spotting jeans, a blue check shirt and sport shoes climbs up. The women check him thoroughly. He is then splashed with sanitiser from shoulder to toe and then taken inside. “This is the only way to at least feel safe. They are sanitised completely. Also, we mostly don’t entertain new guests,” said Guddi. In another brothel, the women revealed that several of their colleagues have left for their hometowns. Rupa, who arrived here from Bengaluru 15 years ago, held her one-and-a-half-year-old son Rohit as she sat on the stairs. She was unkempt and without make-up. “No one has been coming, so what is the point in getting ready? There are hardly any girls left also. Men only come when there are more girls. Let’s see when the situation gets better,” she said. So has been the case at a ‘posh’ brothel, which offers ‘mujra’ every night. The cook and caretaker, who identified himself as Inderjeet, said that many women have left for their villages. And those living in Delhi return to their residence every morning and return late evening. “Ours is a very selective clientele. These days, they call and inform in advance if they are coming. Those we don’t recognise are not allowed to come upstairs,” he said, standing in a huge room on the second floor of the building. The “selected and old clients” also take care of the needs of the brothels, he added. “Everything touched by the client is sanitised, including the doorknobs and edges, chairs and sofas. In fact, there are some clients who have been associated with us for years and take care of our essential needs,” he said. Talking about essential needs, all the women spoke to said that they’ve had no hassles in managing the food. Every 15 days, they are provided with ration, which they can collect from government schools. “Everything, including sugar and tea leaves, is provided. None-essential expenditure is taken care by some means or the other,” said Kajal. Inderjeet, however, said that while business has come down significantly, the area lights up after sunset and “hasn’t lost its glory”.",2020-08-09,TH32307175,NEW DELHI,"Delhi's red light area resumes business after COVID-19 lockdown, embraces unwritten protocols to ensure safety",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/embracing-unwritten-protocols-to-ensure-safety/article32307175.ece

Special Correspondent,"The State Government is looking at ways to promote the sale of handloom products through social media, a Handlooms Department official said here. Officials of the Department, weaver service centres and the weavers from Pollachi and Sirumugai areas had a virtual meeting on Friday to discuss the challenges faced by handloom weavers because of the COVID-19 spread. The meeting was organised as part of the National Handloom Day. With physical distancing restrictions in place, only about 10 weavers from each cluster took part. The official said that with 60 handloom co-operative societies, nearly 15,000 weavers attached to these societies and an equal number of independent weavers, Coimbatore district was one of the largest handloom producing centres. The main challenge faced by these weavers now was marketing. At exhibitions held at industries and colleges on National Handloom Day last year products worth nearly ₹1 crore were sold. The expo could not be held this year owing to COVID-19 restrictions. But, the products need to be marketed. As there were stocks with the societies and weavers were getting some orders, the focus now was on sales. Hence, the government was looking at ways to promote handloom weaves through social media.

Meera Srinivasan,"For almost all Opposition parties in Sri Lanka, Wednesday’s general election spelt huge losses in the face of the landslide victory secured by the ruling party of the Rajapaksas. But one group stood out. The Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA), which represents Malayaha Tamils in the island’s Central, Uva, Sabaragamuwa and Western Provinces, retained all six seats in Parliament. While the number is small compared to the coveted two-thirds majority that the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) secured in the 225-member House, it is not insignificant. How did the TPA’s MPs make it, despite being part of Sajith Premadasa’s weak Opposition alliance and despite a contest with powerful rivals in the Ceylon Workers’ Congress (CWC) aligned to the ruling SLPP? Only two of the CWC’s candidates won, including Jeevan Thondaman, son of former Minister and popular politician Arumugan Thondaman, who suddenly passed away in May. “Trust is the word. That is the reason. The TPA’s achievements in the last four years have outnumbered all past performances of other parties,” said Alliance leader and former Minister Mano Ganesan, who won from Colombo district. Mr. Ganesan’s colleague V. Radhakrishnan from Nuwara Eliya agreed. “People have recognised our work. If they were not happy, we wouldn’t be back,” he said. The TPA could not do much to ensure tea estate workers got the minimum wage despite their incessant protests spanning three years, but its MPs appear to have scored in other areas concerning the million-strong community. Development, for instance. The Alliance shifted the politics of Malayaha Tamils — including some 1.5 lakh people employed in the tea estates — from one of “patronage to [one of] rights”, according to Palani Thigambaram, a former Minister widely credited with building houses in the estates. “We worked to address our people’s right to land and housing, we helped them get original deeds for the first time. We created a dedicated authority for Hill Country development and the people have appreciated that,” he said, adding: “some people think voters are fools. But the fact is voters know what they are doing. It is important to pay attention.” But for this trust built over four years, it may not have been easy for the candidates to win, especially from Mr. Premadasa’s Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), which has been on a weak footing since last November’s presidential poll. Nine months after Mr. Premadasa lost to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the SJB secured just 54 seats, about 24% of the votes, in Wednesday’s general election. Its parent party, the United National Party has been reduced to a single seat. It is both consistent work on the ground and efforts to bring about structural changes that the people have acknowledged, according to B. Gowthaman, a lawyer and civil society activist. “The TPA’s work especially with land rights and bringing local government authorities to work inside the estates, appealed not only to the workers, but also to the intelligentsia within the community, like teachers and other professionals,” he said. While much of TPA’s accomplishments are linked to the Ministries its MPs held, they are not afraid to sit in Opposition now. “We will play a constructive role in Opposition, keeping in mind the interests of the people we represent. We will also work with all Tamil and Muslim parties along with progressive minded Sinhalese, keeping the Sri Lankan identity in mind,” said Mr. Ganesan, a vocal legislator in the last Parliament.",2020-08-09,TH32306174,Colombo,An alliance of Malayaha Tamil MPs that stood out,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/an-alliance-of-malayaha-tamil-mps-that-stood-out/article32306174.ece

Police fired tear gas when some protesters tried to break through the barrier blocking a street leading to Parliament, a Reuters journalist said.

AFP,"U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that he was poised to sign executive orders to extend aid to Americans facing hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic, though negotiations continued between his administration and Democratic leaders in Congress on a new emergency spending bill. “End of the week,” Mr. Trump said on the possible timing of the orders. But he also said his economic team “continues to work in good faith to reach an agreement with Democrats in Congress” on a relief package including unemployment benefits and protections against evictions. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said her party had agreed to lower the relief package size to $2 trillion from $3 trillion, but the White House continues to resist aid to State and local governments that economists say will be critical to avoiding a new round of lay-offs. Mr. Trump said his executive orders would defer payroll tax until at least the end of the year, defer student loan payments and extend an eviction moratorium. He also said he would extend enhanced unemployment benefits until the end of the year — a key source of contention between the White House and Democrats.

AFP,"China on Saturday slammed the U.S. for imposing “barbarous” sanctions in response to Beijing’s crackdown in Hong Kong, capping a dramatic week of deteriorating relations between the world’s two biggest economies. In the toughest U.S. action on Hong Kong since China imposed a sweeping new security law on the territory, Washington on Friday imposed sanctions on a group of Chinese and Hong Kong officials — including the city’s leader Carrie Lam. The move came after President Donald Trump’s administration forced Chinese Internet giants TikTok and WeChat to end all operations in the U.S., in a twin diplomatic-commercial offensive set to grow ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November. China on Saturday criticised the sanctions as “barbarous and rude”. “The ill intentions of U.S. politicians to support people who are anti-China and messing up Hong Kong have been clearly revealed,” Beijing’s Liaison Office in Hong Kong said in a statement. The Treasury Department announced it was freezing the U.S. assets of Chief Executive Carrie Lam and 10 other senior officials, including Luo Huining — the head of the Liaison Office. It accused the sanctioned individuals of being “directly responsible for implementing Beijing’s policies of suppression of freedom and democratic processes”. The move criminalises any U.S. financial transactions with the sanctioned officials. In a short statement, Mr. Luo said he welcomed the blacklisting. “I have done what I should do for the country and for Hong Kong,” he said. “I don’t have a dime’s worth in foreign assets.” The Hong Kong government described the sanctions as “shameless and despicable”. “We will fully support the Central government to adopt countermeasures,” it said in a statement. The city’s commerce secretary Edward Yau warned that the “savage and unreasonable” sanctions could have blowback for American businesses in Hong Kong. China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said the sanctions list “rudely tramples on international law” and “will be nailed to the historic pillar of shame forever.” Facebook barred Ms. Lam and the 10 other sanctioned officials from advertising on the platform, with a spokesperson saying on Saturday that it had “a legal obligation to take action.” Beijing’s security law was imposed in late June, following last year’s huge pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, sending a political chill through the semi-autonomous city. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the security law violated promises made by China ahead of Hong Kong’s 1997 handover that the city could keep key freedoms and autonomy for 50 years. “Today’s actions send a clear message that the Hong Kong authorities’ actions are unacceptable,” said Mr. Pompeo in a statement. The U.S. measures come three months ahead of the November election in which Mr. Trump, who is behind his rival Joe Biden, is campaigning hard on an increasingly strident anti-Beijing message.",2020-08-09,TH32307243,Hong Kong,China’s ties with U.S. plunge further over Hong Kong sanctions,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/chinas-ties-with-us-plunge-further-over-hong-kong-sanctions/article32307243.ece
Reuters,"President Donald Trump signed executive orders on August 8 providing additional financial support to Americans hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic, after his negotiators failed to reach a deal with Congress. Mr. Trump said the orders would provide an extra $400 per week to the tens of millions thrown out of work during a health crisis that has killed more than 1,60,000 Americans, less than the $600 per week level passed earlier in the year. Some of the measures were likely to face legal challenges, as the U.S. Constitution gives Congress authority over federal spending. “This is the money they need, this is the money they want, this gives them an incentive to go back to work,” Mr. Trump said of the lower enhanced unemployment payments. Republicans have argued that the higher payments were a disincentive for unemployed Americans to try to return to work, though economists, including Federal Reserve officials, disputed that assertion. Mr. Trump also said he was suspending collection of payroll taxes, which pay for Social Security and other federal programmes, an idea that he has repeatedly raised but has been rejected by both Democrats and his fellow Republicans in Congress. His orders would also stop evictions from rental housing that has federal financial backing and extend zero per cent interest on federally financed student loans, he said. “Congressional Democrats have stonewalled our efforts to extend this relief,” Mr. Trump told reporters at his New Jersey golf club, in a room that featured a crowd of cheering supporters. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi had pushed to extend the enhanced unemployment payments at the previous rate of $600 per week approved early in the crisis. Nearly two weeks of talks between White House officials and congressional Democrats ended on Friday with the two sides still about $2 trillion apart on next steps to address the heavy human and economic toll the coronavirus pandemic has taken on the United States, where it has killed more than 160,000 people. Mr. Trump initially played down the disease’s threat and has drawn criticism for inconsistent messages on public health steps such as social distancing and masks. The $600-per-week increase in unemployment payments that has served as a lifeline to the tens of millions of Americans who lost their jobs in the pandemic expired at the end of July. Ms. Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Friday offered to reduce a proposed $3.4 trillion coronavirus aid package, which the House passed in May but the Senate ignored, by nearly one-third if Republicans would agree to more than double their $1 trillion counteroffer. White House negotiators Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows rejected the offer. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s $1 trillion package unveiled late last month ran into immediate opposition from his party, with as many as 20 of the Senate’s 53 Republicans expected to oppose it. Democrats have already warned that such executive orders are legally dubious and would likely be challenged in court. They voiced support for others — Ms. Pelosi this week said she would welcome an executive order halting rental evictions. While Mr. Trump had repeatedly floated the idea of executive orders to push relief, Mr. Schumer on Friday said the White House team had acknowledged that power was limited. “The other choice is for them to do executive orders which by their own admission, they said it to us repeatedly, is not close to as good,” Mr. Schumer said. “It doesn’t cover opening of schools. It doesn’t cover testing. It doesn’t cover dealing with rental assistance. It doesn’t cover elections. It doesn’t cover so many things.” A court fight could take months, and Mr. Trump has managed to sidestep Congress on spending before, declaring a national emergency on the U.S.-Mexico border to shift billions of dollars from the defence budget to pay for a wall he promised during his 2016 election campaign. Congress passed legislation to stop him, but there were too few votes in the Republican-controlled Senate to override his veto — a scenario that would likely play out again with less than 90 days to go before the Nov. 3 presidential election.",2020-08-09,TH32307856,BEDMINSTER,Donald Trump signs coronavirus relief orders after talks with Congress break down,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/donald-trump-signs-coronavirus-relief-orders-after-talks-with-congress-break-down/article32307856.ece
AFP,"China has boosted its efforts to influence the U.S. presidential election in November and wants President Donald Trump to lose because it sees him as “unpredictable,” a top U.S. intelligence official said Friday. “We assess that China prefers that President Trump — whom Beijing sees as unpredictable — does not win re-election,” said William Evanina, Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center. “China has been expanding its influence efforts ahead of November 2020 to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressure political figures it views as opposed to China’s interests, and deflect and counter criticism of China,” Mr. Evanina said in a statement. He pointed to China’s criticism of Mr. Trump’s handling of the COVID-19 epidemic, of the U.S. closure of China’s Houston consulate, and of the U.S. administration’s stances on Chinese actions in Hong Kong and the South China Sea. “Beijing recognises that all of these efforts might affect the presidential race,” said Mr. Evanina. Mr. Trump enthusiastically agreed with the warning, which cast him as a threat to Beijing. “China would love us to have an election where Donald Trump lost to sleepy Joe Biden,” he told journalists. Mr. Evanina said Iran is using social media disinformation to divide the country and hurt Mr. Trump, while Russia is meddling to damage the campaign of his Democratic opponent Joe Biden. “This is consistent with Moscow’s public criticism of him when he was Vice-President for his role in the Obama administration’s policies on Ukraine and its support for the anti-Putin opposition inside Russia,” he said. Mr. Trump dismissed the warning that Russia wanted him to see him re-elected, claiming that no U.S. leader has been tougher on Moscow than him.",2020-08-09,TH32307274,Washington,‘Beijing wants unpredictable Trump to lose election’,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/beijing-wants-unpredictable-trump-to-lose-election/article32307274.ece
AP,"Women in Italy can now use the abortion pill on an outpatient basis rather than be hospitalised to terminate a pregnancy. Italy’s Health Minister, Roberto Speranza, announced the change in guidelines in a tweet on August 8. He said it was based on scientific evidence and was an important step forward in line with Italy’s 1978 law legalising abortion. Previously, women in Italy had to admitted to the hospital to take mifepristone, which terminates a pregnancy by causing the embryo to detach from the uterine wall. Women’s groups and pro-choice advocates lobbying for outpatient use had argued that the hospitalisation requirement discouraged use of the drug, given the high levels of conscientious objection to abortion within the Italian health care service. Over the objections of the Catholic Church, Italy in 1978 legalised abortion and in 2009 approved the use of the abortion pill through the seventh week of gestation. Mr. Speranza’s Deputy, Sandra Zampa, has been quoted as saying it was time to review the guidelines given that a decade of experience had showed the drug could be safely administered without hospitalization. The new guidelines say it can be used up to the ninth week. Conservative lawmaker Giorgia Meloni blasted the new guidelines as a stepback for women, saying the do-it-yourself abortion pill taken outside a hospital setting would deprive women of necessary psychological and medical care. In a statement reported by the newspaper of the Italian bishop’s conference, Ms. Meloni said it would make women experience a difficult and dangerous procedure in solitude.",2020-08-09,TH32307376,Rome,Italy approves outpatient use for abortion pill,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/italy-approves-outpatient-use-for-abortion-pill/article32307376.ece

Serena Josephine M.,"The data on the number of doctors who have died of COVID-19 has sparked a political controversy in Tamil Nadu, with two wings of the Indian Medical Association releasing different sets of figures. The Indian Medical Association (headquarters) made an official statement on August 7 that 43 doctors had died of COVID in Tamil Nadu. Both Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar and the State IMA president had rejected the quoted figure earlier this week, after the DMK’s Udhayanidhi Stalin tweeted the data set.  The IMA’s data on State-wise doctors’ deaths was widely circulated on social media earlier this week. In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, IMA (headquarters) disclosed the details of 196 doctors who had died of COVID-19 in the country. The IMA’s submissions included a document containing the deceased doctors’ details like name, age, IMA branch and speciality. Forty-three of them were from T.N. — the highest figure in the country. “The entire data is from within IMA. The details were verified by another IMA member or by local branches. We have published authentic data. When we released only the numbers, it was subjected to varied interpretations. We have now released the names of the doctors. The State can investigate the details and find out whether the deaths were COVID-19 or non-COVID [deaths]. Our concern is that so many doctors have died,” said R.V. Asokan, honorary secretary-general, IMA (HQs). K. Senthil, president of the Tamil Nadu Government Doctors’ Association, said two government doctors had died of COVID-19 in T.N., while C.N. Raja, president of IMA-Tamil Nadu, said that as per their list, 20 private practitioners had died of COVID-19. Hence, 22 doctors had succumbed to the infection in all. Dr. Raja said, “The data that 43 doctors have died is wrong. As soon as we received it, we started to cross-verify the list. We are investigating the deaths, and there seems to be non-COVID deaths too. We have asked all IMA branches to check and get supporting documents,” he said. In the midst of all this, doctors have begun to question if the State government has any data on doctors’ deaths at all. When the data was sought, an official said he would collect the details and then provide them. However, a group of doctors have been collecting details from various doctors’ groups and from Facebook since the start of the pandemic. They have now collated data on the number of doctors — both in government and private sector — who have died of COVID-19 and due to other ailments. “From March till date, 27 doctors have died of COVID-19 in Tamil Nadu. They include two government doctors — Kalyanaraman of Thoothukudi and Sugumaran, chief medical officer of Madurantakam GH. Fourteen other doctors, including five in the government sector, have died of other reasons during the pandemic,” said a doctor, on the condition of anonymity. A majority of those who died of COVID were aged between 40 and 60, and a few above 60. “Repeated exposure to patients and age, along with co-morbidities, put them at a higher risk of infection and higher viral load,” he added. G. R. Ravindranath, general secretary of Doctors Association for Social Equality, demanded the State government to be transparent and release the accurate list of doctors — both from the government and private sectors — who have died of COVID-19. Dr. Raja urged the government to provide solatium for the families of the doctors. The Health Minister could not be reached for comment. A senior health official said data released by IMA was not related to the government. DMK president M.K. Stalin urged the Health Minister to disclose the number of doctors who had died of COVID-19 in T.N. In a tweet, he referred to the data released by IMA. “Hiding deaths is not the way to prevent deaths,” he said.",2020-08-09,TH32307059,CHENNAI,Coronavirus | Indian Medical Association data on death of doctors contradicts Tamil Nadu Health Minister’s statement,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/death-data-released-by-ima-contradicts-ministers-statement/article32307059.ece
Wilson Thomas,"The CB-CID investigating the death of a man believed to be Sri Lankan underworld operative Maddumage Lasantha Chandana Perera, alias Angoda Lokka, early this July here also suspects that he might have been poisoned. The post-mortem certificate of the deceased, a copy of which is with states that the man’s finger and toenails were bluish in colour, a possible indication of poisoning. The senior civil assistant surgeon who performed the autopsy has observed in the document that the body did not have evidence of any ante-mortem external and internal injuries. The heart of the deceased was sent for histopathological examination while viscera samples were preserved and sent for chemical examination. The cause of death will be attributed based on the results of these examinations and the complete post-mortem report will be prepared on the same. Sources at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital, where the autopsy was conducted, said that there was no video record of the procedure as the body did not have external injuries or signs of suspicious death. Several Sri Lankan media had reported in July that Lokka could have been poisoned to death in India, many days before Coimbatore city police issued a statement on August 2 that three persons, including a Sri Lankan woman, were arrested in connection with the death of a man suspected to be Lokka. K. Shankar, Inspector General of Police, CB-CID, said the agency has sought five days custody of the three accused, namely Amani Thanji, D. Sivakamasundari and her friend S. Dyaneswaran from Erode who were arrested for allegedly helping the deceased in obtaining an Aadhaar card and illegal stay in India. The court is likely to hear the custody petition on Wednesday. It is learnt that the seven special teams of the CB-CID have collected a large chunk of information regarding the deceased and the three accused for custodial interrogation. The investigators also found that the deceased underwent a cosmetic plastic surgery on his nose at a private hospital in R.S.

However, even this has been done only in a few districts,” Mr. Sakthivel said. He said that this was a severe blow to several magazines that had already taken a huge hit because of the economic slowdown due to COVID-19 and its subsequent lockdown. In the letter, TAMPA also emphasised the need to increase the percentage of revenue that each library was allowed to spend on subscriptions of magazines and newspapers. “An upper limit of 6.5% of the revenue was set four decades ago, but this was not put into practice. This year, the directorate has stressed that the amount spent on magazines cannot exceed 6.5%,” Mr. Sakthivel noted.

Talking to the media after reviewing COVID-19 preventive measures and development works in Salem district, he said that committees had been formed to study the National Education Policy and the Environment Impact Assessment draft. The State government has followed the two-language policy — Tamil and English — right from the time of former Chief Minister C.N. Annadurai to the time of former Chief Ministers M.G. Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa. “This government, which follows Jayalalithaa’s footsteps, will continue to implement the same,” he said. Regarding increasing the compensation for workers who die while on COVID-19 duty, Mr. Palaniswami said, “A total of ₹50 lakh has been announced for doctors and nurses since they treat COVID-19 patients. The Centre itself has announced that it would be provided through insurance. For other workers, ₹10 lakh was announced and this has been increased to ₹25 lakh and a government job for a person from their family.” On the issuance of e-pass, he said District Collectors had been advised to simplify the process, and additional teams had been formed to issue the passes.

Staff Reporter,"The pandemic and its gendered impact took centre stage at a virtual discussion organised by the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation on Saturday, as experts deconstructed the effect COVID-19 has had on women’s work, nutrition security, reproductive health and education, and gender-based violence. “Pandemics, outbreaks and emergencies, in general, have differential impacts on women and men, and experiences depend on biological and gender characteristics as well as their interaction with other social determinants. Both global and national plans for COVID-19 preparedness and response need to be grounded on a strong gender analysis,” said Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist, World Health Organisation (WHO). Since there was only a limited availability of disaggregated data based on sex and age, she urged the States affected by COVID-19 to collect, report and analyse data based on these and other factors. “A gender analysis of the data can be undertaken and States should invest in quality gender-responsive research on the differential impacts of COVID-19 on men and women,” she added. Highlighting the impact of COVID-19 on women’s work, food and nutrition security, Nitya Rao, professor, University of East Anglia, U.K., spoke about how a large number of women in the informal sector were among the first to be affected when the pandemic struck. “It is necessary to address the devaluation of women’s work as well as all forms of structural violence, that is central to their dignity, equality and justice,” she said. Poonam Muttreja, executive director, Population Foundation of India, stressed the need to provide uninterrupted reproductive and maternal healthcare services. “Studies from across the globe indicate how a lack of investment in family planning is impacting public health measures. Capacity building of women front-line workers, who are large in numbers and are often the only points of contact for women in remote places, should be done, and counselling services should be strengthened,” she said. Stating that gender-based violence would get exacerbated as the pandemic goes on, she said that it was imperative to have a response to this factored into the public health system in the country. Highlighting the increase in the care burden for women, Dr. Kezevino Aram, president, Shanti Ashram, Coimbatore, said that women have had to take up multiple roles that they were previously sharing with other individuals or support services. She stressed on the need for protective measures in the informal sector so that women were not exploited. “From a community point of view, I feel that never before has it been so important for public health interventions to look at decentralised governance as an important medium of building composite responses to the pandemic,” she added. Avni Amin, scientist, Gender Team, Department of Reproductive Health and Research, WHO, spoke about the global gender impact of COVID-19. Among the critical interventions necessary to address the concerns surrounding children affected by the closure of schools and anganwadi centres, is a cluster-mapping exercise, said Anjana Mangalagiri, senior fellow, Institute of Social Sciences. This must be undertaken in each block to update data on children below the age of six, she said. “The rights and needs of children have been largely ignored through the crisis and if there is no focus on their growth and development, this will be a humanitarian crisis in the making,” she added.",2020-08-09,TH32307142,CHENNAI,Gendered impact of COVID-19 takes centre stage at discussion,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/gendered-impact-of-covid-19-takes-centre-stage-at-discussion/article32307142.ece

B. Kolappan,"Reduced to rubble in 1800, the fort of the Marudu Brothers at Aranmanai Siruvayal in Sivaganga district, a symbol of resistance to the British, is gradually rising like as a phoenix. The Archaeology Department of the State government has undertaken the restoration work at a cost of ₹60.13 lakh. “The funding has come from the Asian Development Bank (ADB),” said Ma Foi K. Pandiarajan, Minister for Tamil Development and Culture. The Archaeology Department is using lime and sand paste for the restoration works. While the lime is procured from Kazhugumalai, the sand is sourced from Tiruchi. Workers from Kovilpatti and surrounding areas who have expertise in restoration work are employed. “We are erecting a strong fencing normally designed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI),” he said. The fort and the village fell in the hands of the British on July 30, 1800. “The fine extensive village of Sherewele (Siruvayal), almost destroyed by the flames, which had spread with great fury, accelerated by a high wind, fell into our hands without opposition, although every house was capable of a sturdy defence, and it had a very thick hedge all around it,” Colonel James Welsh, a friend-turned-foe of the Marudu Brothers, had said in his book, the . Welsh maintained a good relationship with Periya Marudu and Chinna Marudu, but fell out with them after they refused to hand over Oomaithurai, the brother of Kattabomman. His reminiscences of the two brothers offer good insights into their characters. The elder brother was called Wella, or Vellu Murdoo, but he had nothing to do with the management of the country. “He was a great sportsman and gave up his whole time to hunting and shooting. Being a man of uncommon stature and strength, it was even said, that he could bend a common Arcot rupee with his fingers,” Welsh had written. Writing about Chinna Marudu, Welsh says, “Though of a dark complexion, he was a portly, handsome, and affable man, of the kindest manners, and most easy access; and though ruling over a people to whom his very nod was a law, he lived in an open Palace, without a single guard.” It was from Chinna Marudu that Welsh learnt how to throw the spear, and hurl the collery stick, a boomerang-like weapon scarcely known elsewhere. In a skilful hand, it could be thrown to any distance within one hundred yards. “Yet this very man, I was afterwards destined by the fortune of war, to chase like a wild beast; to see badly wounded, and captured by common peons; then lingering with a fractured thigh in prison, and lastly, to behold him, with his gallant brother, and no less gallant son, surrounded by their principal adherents, hanging in chains upon a common gibbet,” Welsh had recorded.

Staff Reporter,"The district witnessed a massive spike in COVID-19 cases on Saturday with 485 testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, the highest single-day count to be reported in Thiruvananthapuram. A small respite, however, was that the district also registered its highest number recoveries from COVID-19 on a single day with as many as 777 people testing negative. There were currently 3,022 people being treated for the disease in the district. Among the new COVID-19 cases, as many as 468 have been attributed to local transmission. The source of infection in 33 of them are unknown. Seven health workers have also been infected. The coastal belt continued to witness a resurgence of COVID-19 cases after a lull as was the trend in the last few days. A bulk of the cases that were reported on Saturday were from the critical containment zones. The coastal hamlet of Anjuthengu appeared to be the worst hit with 125 people including the panchayat president and two other members testing positive from among 476 people who were subjected to antigen tests on the day. The total number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 in the region since Thursday is 302 while as many as 1,270 people were tested during the period. With the Anjuthengu grama panchayat president testing positive, Attingal municipal chairman M. Pradeep, the chairman of the health standing committee, municipal secretary, and a few others officials who had taken part in a cremation along with the former on Friday went into self-quarantine for seven days. The Anjuthengu grama panchayat president had also visited the municipal office in connection with conducting the final rites of an Anjuthengu native in the municipality crematorium. During his briefing, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said rising incidence of cases necessitated the extension of stringent containment efforts. He added that the trend could not be interpreted as a failure of the triple lockdown imposed in the State capital. However, pointing out that there has been a let-up in containment measures, he said it could take more time to salvage the situation from worsening any further. Mr. Vijayan also minced no words when he criticised the attack of a COVID first-line treatment centre (FLTC) at Pulluvila on Saturday. Referring to the demands made to close down the facility, the Chief Minister said that it was not up to the public to decide where FLTCs should be established. “Such treatment centres have been found to be necessary all over. They should not be seen as centres that could lead to a proliferation of COVID-19, but those meant to counter such a possibility. The public must refrain from falling prey to falsehoods propagated by a minority. Attacks as these are the most heinous crime meted out to the society,” he said.",2020-08-09,TH32308066,THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,Thiruvananthapuram sees highest spike with 485 new cases,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/thiruvananthapuram-sees-highest-spike-with-485-new-cases/article32308066.ece
